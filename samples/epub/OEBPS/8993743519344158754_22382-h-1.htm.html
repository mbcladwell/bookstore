<h2>BOOK THE FIRST.</h2>
<h4 id="pgepubid00007">ARGUMENT.</h4>
<p>Apollo, enraged at the insult offered to his priest, Chryses, sends a
pestilence upon the Greeks. A council is called, and Agamemnon, being
compelled to restore the daughter of Chryses, whom he had taken from
him, in revenge deprives Achilles of Hippodameia. Achilles resigns her,
but refuses to aid the Greeks in battle, and at his request, his mother,
Thetis, petitions Jove to honour her offended son at the expense of the
Greeks. Jupiter, despite the opposition of Juno, grants her request.</p>

(return) </a> Although, as Ernesti observes, the verb προίαψεν
   does not necessarily contain the idea of a <i>premature</i> death, yet
   the ancient interpreters are almost unanimous in understanding it
   so. Thus Eustathius, p. 13, ed. Bas.: μετὰ βλάζης είς Αιδην πρὁ
   το δέοντος ἔπεμφεν, ὡς τῆς προθέσεως (<i>i.e.</i> προ) καιρικόν τι
   δηλούσης, ἢ ἁπλὡς ἔπεμψεν, ώς πλεοναζούσης τἤς προθέσεως. Hesych.
   t. ii. p. 1029, s. ν.: προίαψεν—δηλοῖ δε διὰ τἤς λέξεως τὴν μετ'
   ỏδὑνης αὐτῶν ἀπώλειαν. Cf. Virg. Æn. xii. 952: “Vitaque cum
   gemitu fugit <i>indignata</i> sub umbras,” where Servius well
   observes, “quia discedebat a juvene: nam volunt philosophi,
   invitam animam discedere a corpore, cum quo adhuc habitare
   legibus naturæ poterat.” I have, however, followed Ernesti, with
   the later commentators.</p>

all the Greeks, but chiefly the two sons of Atreus, the leaders of the
people:</p>
<p>“Ye sons of Atreus, and ye other well-greaved Greeks, to you indeed may
the gods, possessing the heavenly dwellings, grant to destroy the city

Nine days through the army went the arrows of the god; but on the tenth,
Achilles called the people to an assembly; for to his mind the
white-armed goddess Juno had suggested it; for she was anxious
concerning the Greeks, because she saw them perishing. But when they
accordingly were assembled, and were met together, swift-footed
Achilles, rising up amidst them, [thus] spoke:</p>

prophesying amongst the Greeks, thou haranguest that forsooth the
Far-darter works griefs to them upon this account, because I was
unwilling to accept the splendid ransom of the virgin daughter of
Chryses, since I much prefer to have her at home; and my reason is, I
prefer her even to Clytemnestra, my lawful wife; for she is not inferior
to her, either in person, or in figure, or in mind, or by any means in
accomplishments. But even thus I am willing to restore her, if it be

willingly obey thy orders, either to undertake a mission, or to fight
bravely with men? For I did not come hither to fight on account of the
warlike Trojans, seeing that they are blameless as respects me. Since

within, in his hairy breast, was pondering upon two courses; whether,
drawing his sharp sword from his thigh, he should dismiss them,<span id="footnotetag28"/>

should kill the son of Atreus, or should put a stop to his wrath, and
restrain his passion. While he was thus pondering in his heart and soul,
and was drawing his mighty sword from the scabbard, came Minerva from
heaven; for her the white-armed goddess Juno had sent forward, equally
loving and regarding both from her soul. And she stood behind, and
caught the son of Peleus by his yellow hair, appearing to him alone; but
none of the others beheld her. But Achilles was amazed, and turned
himself round, and immediately recognized Pallas Minerva; and
awe-inspiring her eyes appeared to him. And addressing her, he spoke
winged words:</p>
<p>“Why, O offspring of ægis-bearing Jove, hast thou come hither? Is it
that thou mayest witness the insolence of Agamemnon, the son of Atreus?
But I tell thee, what I think will be accomplished, that he will
probably soon lose his life by his haughtiness.”</p>

soul. But come, cease from strife, nor draw the sword with thine hand.

through the wide army of the Achæans, to take away the rewards of
whoever may speak against thee. A people-devouring king [art thou],
since thou rulest over fellows of no account; for assuredly, son of
Atreus, thou [otherwise] wouldst have insulted now for the last time.
But I will tell thee, and I will further swear a great oath: yea, by
this sceptre, which will never bear leaves and branches, nor will bud
again, after it has once left its trunk on the mountains; for the axe
has lopped it all around of its leaves and bark; but now the sons of the
Greeks, the judges, they who protect the laws [received] from Jove, bear
it in their hands; and this will be a great oath to thee; surely will a
longing desire for Achilles come upon all the sons of the Achæans at
some future day, and thou, although much grieved, wilt be unable to
assist them, when many dying shall fall by the hand of man-slaying
Hector. Then enraged, wilt thou inwardly fret thy soul, that thou didst
in no way honour the bravest of the Greeks.”</p>

glory, been allotted an equal share of dignity. But though thou be of

she rose up from the hoary deep, like a mist. And then she sat before
him weeping, and soothed him with her hand, and addressed him, and spoke
aloud:</p>
<p>“Son, why weepest thou—on account of what has grief come upon thy mind?
Declare it, nor hide it in thy soul, that we both may know it.”</p>
<p>But her, sighing deeply, swift-footed Achilles addressed: “Thou knowest;
why should I tell all these things to thee, already knowing [them]? We
went against Thebe,<span id="footnotetag46"/>

plundered, and brought hither all [the spoil]. And these things indeed
the sons of the Greeks fairly divided among themselves, and selected for
Agamemnon the fair-cheeked daughter of Chryses. But Chryses, priest of
the far-darting Apollo, came afterwards to the fleet ships of the
brazen-mailed Greeks, about to ransom his daughter, and bringing
invaluable ransoms, having in his hand the fillets of far-darting
Apollo, on his golden sceptre. And he supplicated all the Greeks, but
chiefly the two sons of Atreus, the leaders of the people. Upon this all
the other Greeks shouted assent, that the priest should be reverenced,
and the splendid ransoms accepted: yet it was not pleasing to Agamemnon,
son of Atreus, in his mind; but he dismissed him evilly, and added a
harsh mandate. The old man therefore went back enraged; but Apollo
hearkened to him praying, for he was very dear to him. And he sent a
destructive arrow against the Greeks; and the forces were now dying one
upon another, and the shafts of the god went on all sides through the
wide army of the Greeks. But to us the skilful seer unfolded the divine
will of the Far-darter. Straightway I first exhorted that we should
appease the god; but then rage seized upon the son of Atreus, and
instantly rising, he uttered a threatening speech, which is now
accomplished; for the rolling-eyed Greeks attend her to Chrysa with a
swift bark, and bring presents to the king; but the heralds have just
now gone from my tent, conducting the virgin daughter of Brisëis, whom
the sons of the Greeks gave to me. But do thou, if thou art able, aid
thy son. Going to Olympus, supplicate Jove, if ever thou didst delight
the heart of Jove as to anything, by word or deed; for I frequently
heard thee boasting in the palaces of my sire, when thou saidest that
thou alone, amongst the immortals, didst avert unworthy destruction from
the cloud-collecting son of Saturn, when the other Olympian inhabitants,
Juno, and Neptune, and Pallas Minerva, wished to bind him. But thou, O

Would that thou wert seated at the ships tearless and uninjured; for thy

<p>Thus having said, she departed, and left him there wrathful in his soul
for his well-girded maid, whom they had taken from him against his will.
But Ulysses, meantime, came to Chrysa, bringing the sacred hecatomb. But
they, when they had entered the deep haven, first furled their sails,
and stowed them in the sable bark; they next brought the mast to its
receptacle, lowering it quickly by its stays, and they rowed the vessel
forwards with oars into its moorage; they heaved out the sleepers, and
tied the hawsers. They themselves then went forth on the breakers of the
sea, and disembarked the hecatomb to far-darting Apollo, and then they
made the daughter of Chryses descend from the sea-traversing bark. Then
wise Ulysses, leading her to the altar, placed her in the hands of her
dear father, and addressed him:</p>
<p>“O Chryses, Agamemnon, king of men, sent me forth to conduct to thee thy
daughter, and to sacrifice a sacred hecatomb to Phœbus for the Greeks,
that we may appease the king, who now has sent evils fraught with
groanings upon the Argives.”</p>
<p>Thus having spoken, he placed her in his hands; but he rejoicing
received his beloved daughter. Then they immediately placed in order the
splendid hecatomb for the god around the well-built altar. After that
they washed their hands, and held up the pounded barley.<span id="footnotetag51"/>

   barley,”—Voss; but Buttmann, Lexil. p. 454, in a highly amusing
   note, observes, “no supposition of a regular and constant
   distinction between the Greeks and Romans, the one using barley
   whole and the other coarsely ground, possible as the thing may
   be in itself, is to be entertained without the express testimony
   of the ancients.”</p>
<p>“Hear me, O thou of the silver bow, who art wont to protect Chrysa and
divine Cilla, and who mightily rulest over Tenedos! already indeed at a
former time didst thou hear me praying, and didst honour me, and didst
very much afflict the people of the Greeks, now also accomplish for me
this further request: even now avert from the Greeks this unseemly
pestilence.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke praying, and him Phœbus Apollo heard. But after they had
prayed, and sprinkled the pounded barley, they first bent back [the neck
of the victims], killed them, and flayed them, and cut out the thighs,
and wrapped them round with the fat, having arranged it in double folds;
then laid the raw flesh upon them. Then the old man burned them on
billets, and poured sparkling wine upon them; and near him the youths
held five-pronged spits in their hands. But after the thighs were
roasted, and they had tasted the entrails, they then cut the rest of
them into small pieces, and fixed them on spits, and roasted them
skilfully, and drew all the viands [off the spits].</p>
<p>But when they had ceased from their labour, and had prepared the
banquet, they feasted; nor did their soul in anywise lack a due
allowance of the feast: but when they had dismissed the desire of drink
and food, the youths on the one hand filled the goblets with wine to the
brim,<span id="footnotetag52"/>

the dark wave roared loudly around the keel; but she scudded through the
wave, holding on her way. But when they reached the wide armament of the
Greeks, they drew up the black ship on the continent, far upon the sand,
and stretched long props under it; but they dispersed themselves through
their tents and ships.</p>

<p>But the Jove-sprung son of Peleus, swift-footed Achilles, continued his

the gods who are for ever went together to Olympus, but Jupiter
preceded. But Thetis was not forgetful of the charges of her son, but
she emerged from the wave of the sea, and at dawn ascended lofty heaven
and Olympus;<span id="footnotetag58"/>

apart from the others, on the highest summit of many-peaked Olympus, and
then she sat down before him, and embraced his knees with her left hand,
but with the right taking him by the chin, imploring, she thus addressed
king Jove, the son of Saturn:</p>
<p>“O father Jove, if ever I have aided thee among the immortals, either in
word or deed, accomplish for me this desire: honour my son, who is the
most short-lived of others; for now indeed Agamemnon, the king of men,
has disgraced him; for he possesses his prize, he himself having borne
it away. Do thou at least, Olympian Jove all counselling, honour him:
and so long grant victory to the Trojans, until the Greeks shall
reverence my son, and shall advance him in honour.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote57"/><b>Footnote 57:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-1.htm.html#footnotetag57" class="pginternal">

   ether, into which Olympus soared up.—Voss.</p>
<p>Thus she spoke; but cloud-compelling Jove answered her nothing, but sat
silent for a long time. And as Thetis seized his knees, fast clinging
she held them, and thus again entreated: “Do but now promise to me
explicitly, and grant or refuse, (for in thee there is no dread,) that I
may well know how far I am the most dishonoured goddess amongst all.”</p>
<p>But her cloud-compelling Jove, deeply moved, addressed: “Truly now this
[will be] a grievous matter, since thou wilt cause me to give offence to
Juno, when she shall irritate me with reproachful words. For, even
without reason, she is perpetually chiding me amongst the immortal gods,
and also says that I aid the Trojans in battle. But do thou on thy part
now depart, lest Juno behold thee: but these things shall be my care,
until I perform them. But if [thou wilt have it thus], so be it; I will
nod to thee with my head, that thou mayest feel confidence. For this
from me is the greatest pledge among the immortals: for my pledge, even
whatsoever I shall sanction by nod, is not to be retracted, neither
fallacious nor unfulfilled.”</p>
<p>The son of Saturn spoke, and nodded thereupon with his dark eyebrows.
And then the ambrosial locks of the king were shaken over him from his
immortal head; and he made mighty Olympus tremble. Thus having
conferred, they separated. She at once plunged from splendid Olympus
into the profound sea. But Jove on the other hand [returned] to his
palace. But all the gods rose up together from their seats to meet their
sire; nor did any dare to await<span id="footnotetag59"/>

presence. Thus indeed he sat there on his throne; nor was Juno
unconscious, having seen that silver-footed Thetis, the daughter of the
marine old man, had joined in deliberation with him. Forthwith with
reproaches she accosted Saturnian Jove:</p>
<p>“Which of the gods again, O deceitful one, has been concerting measures
with thee? Ever is it agreeable to thee, being apart from me, plotting
secret things, to decide thereon; nor hast thou ever yet deigned
willingly to tell me one word of what thou dost meditate.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote59"/><b>Footnote 59:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-1.htm.html#footnotetag59" class="pginternal">
(return) </a> Heyne supplies “sedendo.”</p>
<p>To her then replied the father of men and gods: “O Juno, build up no
hopes of knowing all my counsels; difficult would they be for thee,
although thou art my consort. But whatever it may be fit for thee to
hear, none then either of gods or men shall know it before thee: but
whatever I wish to consider apart from the gods, do thou neither inquire
into any of these things, nor investigate them.”</p>
<p>But him the large-eyed, venerable Juno then answered: “Most dread son
of Saturn, what a word hast thou spoken? Heretofore have I ever
questioned thee much, nor pryed [into thy secrets]; but thou mayest very
quietly deliberate on those things which thou desirest. But at present I
greatly fear in my soul, lest silver-footed Thetis, the daughter of the
marine old man, may have influenced thee: for at dawn she sat by thee
and embraced thy knees: to her I suspect thou didst plainly promise that
thou wouldest honour Achilles, and destroy many at the ships of the
Greeks.”</p>
<p>But her answering, cloud-compelling Jove addressed: “Perverse one! thou
art always suspecting, nor do I escape thee. Nevertheless thou shalt
produce no effect at all, but thou shalt be farther from my heart: and
this will be more bitter to thee. But granted this be so, it appears to
be my pleasure.<span id="footnotetag60"/>

<p>Thus he spoke: but venerable, large-eyed Juno feared, and sat down
silent, having bent her heart to submission. But the heavenly gods
murmured throughout the palace of Jove. And the renowned artificer,
Vulcan, began to harangue them, doing kind offices to his beloved
mother, white-armed Juno:</p>
<p>“Truly now these will be grievous matters, and no longer tolerable, if
