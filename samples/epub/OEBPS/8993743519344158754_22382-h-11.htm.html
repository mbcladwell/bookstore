<h2>BOOK THE ELEVENTH.</h2>
<h4 id="pgepubid00028">ARGUMENT.</h4>
<p>Agamemnon distinguishes himself, but, being wounded, retires from the
field. Diomede is wounded by Paris: Ulysses by Socus. Ajax and Menelaus
then go to the relief of Ajax, and Eurypylus, who had joined them, is
shot in the thigh by Paris, who also wounds Machaon. Nestor conveys
Machaon from the field. Achilles sends Patroclus to the tent of Nestor,
who exhorts Patroclus to engage in battle, assuming the armour of
Achilles.</p>
<p class="p2">
But Aurora was rising from her couch, from beside glorious Tithonus,
that she might bear light to immortals and to mortals, when Jove sent
forth fell Discord to the swift ships of the Greeks, bearing in her
hands the portent of war. And she stood upon the huge<span id="footnotetag359"/>

Ulysses, which was in the centre, to shout to both sides, as well to the
tents of Telamonian Ajax, as to those of Achilles; who had both drawn up
their equal ships at the very extremities, relying on their valour and
strength of hands. There standing, the goddess shouted both loudly and
terribly, in Orthian strain,<span id="footnotetag360"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-11.htm.html#footnote360" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">360</sup></a> to the Greeks, and implanted mighty
strength in the heart of each, to war and fight incessantly. And
immediately war became more sweet to them, than to return in the hollow
ships to their dear fatherland. Then the son of Atreus shouted aloud,
and ordered the Greeks to be girded; and arrayed himself, putting on his
shining armour. First he put upon his legs his beautiful greaves, fitted
with silver clasps; next he placed around his breast a corslet which
Cinyras once gave him, to be a pledge of hospitality. For a great rumour
was heard at Cyprus, that the Greeks were about to sail to Troy in
ships: wherefore he gave him this, gratifying the king. Ten bars indeed
[of the corslet] were of dark cyanus<span id="footnotetag361"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-11.htm.html#footnote361" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">361</sup></a>, twelve of gold, and twenty of
tin; and three serpents of cyanus stretched towards the neck on each
side, like unto rainbows, which the son of Saturn hath fixed in a
cloud<span id="footnotetag362"/>

he hung his sword, on which glittered golden studs; and a silver
scabbard enclosed it, fitted with golden rings. Next he took up his
shield, mortal-covering<span id="footnotetag363"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-11.htm.html#footnote363" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">363</sup></a>, variously wrought, strong, beautiful,
around which were ten brazen orbs. Upon it were twenty white bosses of
tin, and in the midst was [one] of dark cyanus. On it a grim-visaged
Gorgon was placed as an ornament, looking horribly, and around [were]
Terror and Flight. The belt was of silver, but round it a snake of
cyanus was twisted, and there were three heads entwined, springing from
one neck. Upon his head also he placed his helmet, adorned with studs on
all sides, having four bosses, crested with horse-hair, and dreadfully
nodded the tuft from above. He then took two strong spears, tipped with
brass, sharp; and the brass of them glittered afar, even to heaven: and
Minerva and Juno thundered above, honouring the king of Mycenæ, rich in
gold.</p>
<p>Then indeed each gave orders to his own charioteer to hold there his
horses in good order by the fosse; whilst they themselves on foot<span id="footnotetag364"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-11.htm.html#footnote364" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">364</sup></a>,
arrayed with their armour, rushed forth; and an inextinguishable clamour
arose before morning. And they<span id="footnotetag365"/>

with the cavalry at the trench; the cavalry followed at a little
interval; but the son of Saturn aroused a dreadful tumult, and sent down
dew-drops, moist with blood, from the air above, because he was about to
hurl many brave souls on to Hades.</p>
<p>On the other side, on the contrary, the Trojans [drew up] on a hill in
the plain around both mighty Hector, blameless Polydamas, and Æneas,
who, among the Trojans, was honoured by the people as a god; and the
three sons of Antenor, Polybus, noble Agenor, and youthful Acamas, like
unto the immortals. And Hector in the van carried his shield, equal on
all sides. And as when a pernicious star makes its appearance from the
clouds, at one time shining, and dark again hath entered the clouds; so
Hector, giving orders, appeared now among the first, and now among the
last; and he glittered all over with brass, like the lightning of
ægis-bearing Jove.</p>

<p>And they,—as when reapers opposite to each other form swathes of wheat
or barley along the field of a rich man, and the frequent handfuls
fall,—so the Trojans and Greeks, rushing against one another, kept
slaughtering: and neither thought of pernicious flight. And they held
their heads equal in combat, and rushed on like wolves; whilst
lamentable Discord, looking on, exulted: for she alone of the gods was
present with them contending. But the other gods were not present with
them, but sat quiet in their palaces, where beautiful mansions were
built for each, along the summits of Olympus. All however blamed the
Saturnian collector of dark clouds, because he wished to afford glory to
the Trojans. But the sire did not regard them, but retiring by himself,
sat down apart from the others, exulting in glory, looking both upon the
city of the Trojans, and the ships of the Greeks, and the brightness of
armour, and the slaying, and slain.</p>
<p>Whilst it was morn, and the sacred day was increasing, so long the
weapons reached both sides, and the people fell. But at the time when
the wood-cutter<span id="footnotetag366"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-11.htm.html#footnote366" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">366</sup></a> has prepared his repast in the dells of a mountain,
when he has wearied his hands hewing down lofty trees, and satiety comes
upon his mind, and the desire of sweet food seizes his breast; then the
Greeks, by their valour, broke the phalanxes, cheering their companions
along the ranks. But Agamemnon first leaped forth, and slew the hero
Bianor, the shepherd of the people, and then also his companion, Oïleus,
the goader of steeds. For he then, leaping from the chariot, stood
against him; but he (Agamemnon) smote him, as he was rushing straight
forward, with his sharp spear, in the forehead; nor did the visor, heavy
with brass, retard the weapon, but it penetrated both it and the bone,
and all the brain within was stained with gore. Him then he subdued
while eagerly rushing on. And Agamemnon, king of men, left them there
with their bosoms all bare, for he had stripped off their tunics. Next
he went against Isus and Anthipus, two sons of Priam, [the one]
illegitimate, and [the other] legitimate, being both in one chariot, in
order to slay them. The spurious [son] guided the chariot, whilst
illustrious Antiphus fought. Them Achilles had once bound with tender
osiers on the summits of Ida, taking them while pasturing their sheep;
and had liberated them for a ransom. Then however the son of Atreus,
wide-ruling Agamemnon, struck one upon the breast above the pap with his
spear; and again he smote Antiphus beside the ear with his sword, and
hurled him from his chariot. Hastening up, he despoiled them of their
beautiful armour, recognizing them; for he had formerly seen them at the
swift ships, when swift-footed Achilles brought them from Ida. And as a
lion, returning to his lair, easily crushes the little fawns of the
fleet hind, seizing them in his strong teeth, and deprives them of their
tender life, whilst she, although she happen [to be] very near, cannot
aid them; for a dreadful tremor comes upon herself; but hastening, she
immediately flies through the thick oak groves and the forest, sweating,
through the attack of the wild beast. Thus no one of the Trojans was
then able to avert destruction from these, but they themselves were put
to flight by the Greeks. Next [he attacked] Pisander and Hippolochus,
brave in battle, the sons of warlike Antimachus, who having accepted
gold from Paris, rich gifts, would not suffer them to restore Helen to
yellow-haired Menelaus. His two sons, then, Agamemnon, king of men,
seized, being in one chariot, for they drove their fleet horses
together; for the splendid reins had fallen from their hands, and they
were confounded. But the son of Atreus rushed against them like a lion,
and they, on the contrary, supplicated [him] from the chariot:</p>
<p>“Take us alive, O son of Atreus, and thou shalt receive worthy ransoms.
For many treasures lie in the houses of Antimachus, brass, gold, and
variously-wrought iron. From these would our father give infinite
ransoms, if he should hear that we were alive at the ships of the
Greeks.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote366"/><b>Footnote 366:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-11.htm.html#footnotetag366" class="pginternal">
(return) </a> Compare the similar allusion to rustic pursuits in
   xvi. 779, with Buttm. Lexil. p. 89.</p>
<p>Thus both weeping addressed the king with soothing words; but heard an
unsoothing reply: “If indeed ye be the sons of warlike Antimachus, who
once in an assembly of the Trojans, ordered that they should there put
to death Menelaus, coming as an ambassador along with godlike Ulysses,
and not send him back to the Greeks—now surely shall ye pay the penalty
of the unmerited insolence of your father.”</p>
<p>He said, and hurled Pisander from his horses to the ground, striking him
on the breast with his spear; and he was stretched supine upon the soil.
But Hippolochus leaped down, whom next he slew upon the ground, having
lopped off his hands with his sword, and cut off his neck; and it (the
head) like a cylinder, he hurled forward, to be rolled through the
crowd. These then he left there; and where very many phalanxes were
thrown into confusion, there he rushed, and at the same time other
well-greaved Greeks. Infantry slew infantry, flying from necessity, and
horse [slew] horse, slaughtering with the brass (whilst the dust was
raised by them from the plain, which the loud-sounding feet of the
horses excited); but king Agamemnon, constantly slaying, pursued,
cheering on the Greeks. And as when a destructive fire falls upon a
woody forest, and the wind whirling carries it on all sides, whilst the
branches fall with the roots, overwhelmed by the violence of the flame;
so fell the heads of the flying Trojans, at the hand of Agamemnon, son
of Atreus, and many lofty-necked steeds rattled their empty chariots
through the ranks<span id="footnotetag367"/>

charioteers; but they lay upon the earth, far more agreeable to the
vultures than to their wives.</p>

<p>But Jove withdrew Hector out of the reach of weapons, of dust, of
slaughter, blood and tumult, whilst Atrides pursued, loudly cheering on
the Danai. [The Trojans] meanwhile rushed through the middle of the
plain towards the wild fig-tree, near the tomb of Ilus, the descendant
of ancient Dardanus, eager to reach the city; but Atrides still followed
shouting, and stained his invincible hands with dusty gore. But when now
they reached the Scæan gates and the beech-tree, there at length they
halted, and awaited each other. Others, however, still fled through the
middle of the plain, like oxen which a lion, coming at the depth of
night, hath put tremblingly to flight—all, but to some one dreadful
destruction is apparent; whose neck he first completely breaks, seizing
it in his strong teeth; and then laps up both the blood and all the
entrails: thus did the son of Atreus, king Agamemnon, follow them,
always killing the hindermost; and they kept flying. Many fell prone and
supine from their chariots, by the hands of the son of Atreus; for
before [all others] he raged exceedingly with the spear. But when now he
was about soon to reach the city and the lofty wall, then indeed the
father both of men and gods, descending from heaven, seated himself upon
the tops of Ida, of many rills. And he held the lightning in his hands,
and aroused golden-winged Iris to bear his message:</p>
<p>“Come, swift Iris, deliver this message to Hector. As long as he may
behold Agamemnon, the shepherd of the people, raging in the van, [and]
destroying the ranks of men, so long let<span id="footnotetag368"/>

exhort the rest of the army to fight with the enemy during the violent
contest. But when he (Agamemnon) shall have mounted his steeds, either
smitten by a spear, or wounded by an arrow, then will I supply him with
strength to slay,<span id="footnotetag369"/>

<p>Thus he spake; nor did rapid Iris, swift as the wind on her feet,
disobey. But she descended from the mountains of Ida, towards sacred
Ilium. She found noble Hector, son of warlike Priam, standing in the
midst of the horses and well-joined chariots: and having approached,
swift-footed Iris addressed him:</p>
<p>“Hector, son of Priam, equal in counsel to Jove, Jove hath sent me
forward to deliver to thee this message: As long as thou seest
Agamemnon, the shepherd of the people, raging amongst the van, [and]
destroying the ranks of men, so long do thou abstain from combat, but
exhort the rest of the army to fight with the enemy during the violent
contest. But when he shall have mounted his steeds, either smitten with
a spear, or wounded by an arrow, then will he supply thee with strength
to slay, until thou reach the well-benched ships, and the sun set, and
sacred darkness come on.”</p>
<p>Thus having spoken, swift-footed Iris departed. But Hector with his
armour sprang from his chariot to the ground, and brandishing sharp
spears, ranged through the army on every side, inciting them to fight,
and stirred up the dreadful battle. They indeed rallied, and stood
opposite to the Greeks; but the Greeks, on the other hand, strengthened
their phalanxes. And the battle was renewed, and they stood front to
front. But Agamemnon first rushed on, for he wished to fight far before
all.</p>
<p>Tell me now, ye muses, possessing Olympian dwellings, who first, either
of the Trojans or illustrious allies, now came against Agamemnon?
Iphidamas, son of Antenor, both valiant and great, who was nurtured in
fertile Thrace, the mother of flocks. Cisseus, his maternal grandfather,
who begat fair-cheeked Theano, reared him in his house whilst yet a
little boy: but when he had attained the measure of glorious youth, he
there detained him, and gave him his own daughter. And having married
her, he came from the bridal chamber, on the rumour of the Greeks, with
twelve curved vessels which followed him. The equal ships indeed he
afterwards left at Percote, but he, proceeding on foot, had arrived at
Troy; and he it was who then came against Agamemnon, the son of Atreus.
When these, advancing against each other, were now near, the son of
Atreus on his part missed, and his spear was turned aside. But Iphidamas
smote him upon the belt, under the corslet; and he put his strength to
it, relying on his strong hand. Yet he pierced not the flexible belt,
but meeting with the silver long before, the point was turned like lead.
Then indeed wide-ruling Agamemnon, seeing it in his hand, pulled it
towards him, exasperated, like a lion, and plucked it from his hand; and
he smote him on the neck with his sword, and relaxed his limbs. Thus he,
unhappy, while aiding his citizens, falling there, slept a brazen sleep,
away from his lawful virgin wife, whose charms he had not yet known,
although he had given many presents [for her].<span id="footnotetag370"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-11.htm.html#footnote370" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">370</sup></a> First he gave a
hundred oxen, and then he promised a thousand goats and sheep together,
which were pastured for him in countless numbers. Him Agamemnon, son of
Atreus, at that time stripped [of his arms], and went through the army
of the Greeks, bearing his rich armour. Whom when Coon,<span id="footnotetag371"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-11.htm.html#footnote371" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">371</sup></a> the eldest
born of Antenor, conspicuous amongst men, then beheld, violent grief
darkened his eyes, for his brother having fallen, and he stood aside
with his spear, escaping the notice of noble Agamemnon. And he wounded
him in the middle of the arm, below the elbow, and the point of the
shining spear passed right through to the other side. Then indeed
Agamemnon, the king of men, shuddered; but not even thus did he abstain
from battle or from war, but he rushed upon Coon, holding his
wind-nurtured spear.<span id="footnotetag372"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-11.htm.html#footnote372" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">372</sup></a> He on his part was eagerly dragging by the
foot Iphidamas his brother, and begotten by the same father, and was
calling upon every brave man, when [Agamemnon] wounded him with his
polished brazen spear below the bossy shield, whilst dragging him
through the crowd, and relaxed his limbs; and, standing beside him, cut
off his head over Iphidamas. There the sons of Antenor, fulfilling their
destiny at the hands of the king, the son of Atreus, descended to the
abode of Hades. But he was ranging about through the ranks of other men,
with his spear, his sword, and huge stones, whilst the warm blood yet
oozed from his wound. When, however, the wound grew dry, and the blood
ceased [to flow], sharp pains possessed the strength of Atreus’s son.
And as when the sharp pang seizes a woman in travail, piercing, which
the Ilithyiæ, daughters of Juno, who preside over childbirth, send
forth, keeping bitter pangs in their possession; so did sharp anguish
enter the strength of the son of Atreus. And he sprang into his chariot,
and ordered his charioteer to drive on to the hollow ships; for he was
tortured at heart. And vociferating, he shouted aloud to the Greeks:</p>
<p>“O friends, leaders, and rulers over the Argives, repel ye now the
severe battle from the sea-traversing barks, since provident Jove does
not permit me to combat all day with the Trojans.”</p>

<p>Thus he spoke; and the charioteer lashed on the fair-maned steeds
towards the hollow ships; and they, not unwilling, flew. They were
covered with foam as to their breasts, and were sprinkled beneath with
dust, as they bore the afflicted king apart from the battle. But Hector,
when he observed Agamemnon going apart, exhorted both the Trojans and
Lycians, shouting aloud:</p>
<p>“Ye Trojans, Lycians, and close-fighting Dardanians, be men, my friends,
and be mindful of impetuous might. The bravest hero has departed, and
Saturnian Jove has given great glory to me. But straightway urge your
solid-hoofed horses against the gallant Greeks, that ye may bear off
higher glory.”</p>
<p>Thus saying, he aroused the courage and spirit of each. As when
perchance some huntsman should urge his white-toothed dogs against a
rustic wild boar or lion; so Hector, the son of Priam, equal to
man-slaughtering Mars, urged the magnanimous Trojans against the Greeks.
He himself, having mighty courage, advanced among the first, and rushed
into the battle, like unto a storm blowing from above, and which rushing
down, stirs up the purple deep.</p>
<p>Then whom first and whom last, did Hector, son of Priam, slay, when Jove
gave him glory? Assæus indeed first, and Autonoüs, and Opites, and
Dolops, son of Clytis, and Opheltius, and Agelaus, and Æsymnus, and
Orus, and Hipponoüs, persevering in fight. These leaders of the Greeks
he then slew, and afterwards the common crowd; as when the west wind

whilst the foam is scattered on high by the far-straying blast of the
wind; thus were many heads of the people subdued by Hector. Then indeed
would there have been ruin; and inevitable deeds had been done, and the
flying Greeks had fallen in flight into their ships, had not Ulysses
encouraged Diomede, the son of Tydeus:</p>
<p>“Son of Tydeus, through what cause are we forgetful of impetuous might?
But come hither, my friend, stand by me; for surely it will be a
disgrace if indeed crest-tossing Hector take the ships.”</p>

<p>He said, and hurled Thymbræus from his chariot to the ground, striking
him with his spear upon the left pap; but Ulysses [slew] Molion, the
godlike attendant of the king. These then they left, since they caused
them to cease from war. Then both, advancing through the multitude,
excited confusion; as when two boars, full of courage, rush upon the
hounds; so they returning to the fight, cut down the Trojans; and the
Greeks joyfully gained a respite, avoiding noble Hector. Next they took
a chariot and two warriors, the bravest of the people, the two sons of
Percosian Merops, who above all was skilled in augury, nor would permit
his sons to march to the man-destroying war: yet did they not obey him,
because the destinies of black death led them on. Them spear-renowned
Diomede, the son of Tydeus, depriving of life and breath, despoiled of
their splendid armour. And Ulysses slew Hippodamus and Hyperochus.</p>
<p>Then the son of Saturn, looking down from Ida, stretched for them the
contest with equal tension, and they slaughtered one another. The son of
Tydeus indeed wounded on the hip, with his spear, the hero Agastrophus,
son of Pæon; for his horses were not at hand for him to take flight; but
he had erred greatly in his mind, for his attendant kept them apart,
whilst he rushed on foot through the foremost combatants, till he lost
his life. But Hector quickly perceived it along the ranks, and hastened
towards them, shouting; and with him followed the phalanxes of the
Trojans. Diomede, brave in the din of battle, beholding him, shuddered,
and immediately addressed Ulysses, who was near:</p>
<p>“Towards us is this great destruction, dreadful Hector, now rolled. But
come, let us stand firm, and awaiting, repulse [him].”</p>
<p>He said, and brandishing his long-shadowed spear, hurled it, and smote
him on the summit of the helmet on his head; nor, aiming did he miss.
But brass wandered from brass, nor did it reach the white skin; for the
threefold oblong helmet stopped it, which Phœbus Apollo had given him.
Hector hastily retired to a distance, and was mingled with the crowd.
And he (Hector) falling upon his knee, remained so, and supported
himself with his strong hand against the earth, whilst dark night
overshadowed his eyes. But whilst the son of Tydeus was following after
the impulse of the spear far through the foremost combatants, where it
was fixed in the earth, Hector, in the meantime, breathed again, and
springing again into his chariot, drove into the crowd, and avoided
black death. And valiant Diomede, rushing upon him with his spear,
addressed him:</p>
<p>“Dog, thou hast escaped indeed death at present, although destruction
approached near thee. Now again has Phœbus Apollo rescued thee, to whom
thou art wont to offer prayers, advancing into the clash of spears. But
I will assuredly make an end of thee, meeting thee again, if perchance
any one of the gods be an ally to me. Now, however, I will go against
others, whomsoever I can find.”</p>
<p>He said, and slew the spear-renowned son of Pæon. But Paris, the husband
of fair-haired Helen, leaning against a pillar, at the tomb of the
deceased hero, Dardanian Ilus, the aged leader of the people, bent his
bow against the son of Tydeus, the shepherd of the people. Whilst he was
removing the variegated corslet from the breast of gallant Agastrophus,
the shield from his shoulders, and his heavy casque, he (Paris) in the
meantime was drawing back the horn of his bow, and struck him on the
broad part of the right foot, nor did the weapon escape in vain from his
hand; and the arrow went entirely into the ground. And he, laughing very
joyfully, sprang from his ambuscade, and boasting, spoke:</p>
<p>“Thou art struck, nor has the weapon escaped me in vain. Would that,
striking thee in the lower part of the groin, I had deprived thee of
life. Thus, indeed, would the Trojans have respired from destruction,
who now are thrilled with horror at thee, as bleating goats at the
lion.”</p>
<p>But him valiant Diomede, undismayed, addressed:</p>
<p>“Archer, reviler, decked out with curls, woman’s man, if now in arms
thou wouldst make trial of me, hand to hand, thy bow should not avail
thee, and numerous arrows<span id="footnotetag376"/>

of my foot, thou boastest thus. I regard it not, as though a woman had
wounded me, or a silly boy: for idle is the weapon of an unwarlike,
good-for-nothing man. From me, indeed, it is otherwise; for if one be
touched but slightly, the weapon is piercing, and forthwith renders him
lifeless; and the cheeks of his wife are furrowed on both sides, and his
children are orphans; but crimsoning the earth with his blood, he
putrefies, and the birds around him are more numerous than the women.”</p>

<p>Thus he spoke; but spear-renowned Ulysses coming near, stood before him,
and he (Diomede) sitting down behind him, drew the swift shaft out of
his foot, and severe agony darted through his body. Then he leaped into
his chariot, and commanded his charioteer to drive to the hollow ships;
for he was grieved at heart. But spear-renowned Ulysses was left alone,
nor did any of the Greeks remain beside him, as fear had seized upon
all. Wherefore, groaning inwardly, he addressed his own mighty soul:</p>
<p>“Alas! what will become of me? Great would be the disgrace if I fly,
alarmed at the multitude; but worse would it be if I were taken alone:
but the son of Saturn hath struck the rest of the Greeks with terror.
But wherefore does my spirit discuss these things with me? for I know
that cowards indeed retire from the battle; but whosoever should be
brave in combat, it is altogether necessary that he stand firmly,
whether he be wounded, or wound another.”</p>
<p>Whilst he revolved these things within his mind and soul, the ranks of
the shielded Trojans in the meantime came upon him, and enclosed him in
the midst, placing [their] bane in the midst of them. As when dogs and
vigorous youths rush against a boar on all sides, but he comes out from
a deep thicket, sharpening his white tusk within his crooked jaws; on
all sides they rush upon him, and a gnashing of teeth arises: but they
remain at a distance from him, terrible as he is: so the Trojans did
rush round Ulysses, dear to Jove. But he wounded above the shoulder
blameless Deïopites, springing upon him with his sharp spear; and
afterwards he slew Thoön and Ennomous. With his spear he next wounded
Chersidamas, when leaping from his chariot, in the navel, below his
bossed shield; but he, falling amid the dust, grasped the earth with the
hollow of his hand. These indeed he left, and next wounded with his
spear Charops, son of Hippasus, and brother of noble Socus. But Socus,
godlike hero, hastened to give him aid; and approaching very near, he
stood, and addressed him in these words:</p>
<p>“O illustrious Ulysses, insatiable in crafts and toil, to-day shalt
thou either boast over the two sons of Hippasus, having slain such
heroes, and stripped them of their arms, or else stricken by my spear,
thou shalt lose thy life.”</p>
<p>Thus saying, he smote him upon the shield equal on all sides. The rapid
weapon penetrated the shining shield, and was fixed through the
curiously-wrought corslet, and tore off all the skin from his sides. But
Pallas Minerva suffered it not to be mingled with the entrails of the
hero. And Ulysses perceived that the weapon had not come upon him
mortally, and retiring, he addressed [this] speech to Socus:</p>
<p>“Ah! wretch; very soon indeed will dreadful destruction overtake thee.
Without doubt thou hast caused me to cease from fighting with the
Trojans, but I declare that death and black fate shall be thine this
day; and that, subdued beneath my spear, thou shalt give glory to me,
and thy soul to steed-famed Pluto.” <span id="footnotetag377"/>

<p>He said, and the other, turning again to flight, had begun to retreat,
but whilst he was turning, he (Ulysses) fixed his spear in his back
between the shoulders, and drove it through his breast. Falling, he made
a crash, and noble Ulysses boasted over him:</p>
<p>“O Socus, son of warlike, horse-breaking Hippasus, the end of death has
anticipated thee, nor hast thou escaped. Ah! wretch, neither thy father
nor venerable mother shall close thine eyes for thee, dead as thou art,
but ravenous birds shall tear thee, flapping about thee with dense
wings: but when I die, the noble Greeks will pay me funeral honours.”</p>
<p>So saying, he plucked the strong spear of warlike Socus out of his flesh
and bossy shield; and his blood gushed forth as he drew it out, and
tortured his mind. But the magnanimous Trojans, when they beheld the
blood of Ulysses, encouraging one another through the crowd, all rushed
on against him; whilst he kept retreating backwards, and called to his
companions. Thrice did he then shout as much as the head of mortal could
contain, and thrice warlike Menelaus heard him exclaiming, and instantly
addressed Ajax, being near:</p>
<p>“Most noble Ajax, son of Telamon, chieftain of the people, the cry of
invincible Ulysses has come upon me, like to that, as if the Trojans
were greatly pressing upon him, being alone, having cut him off in the
sharp fight. Wherefore let us go through the crowd, as it is better to
aid him. I fear lest being left alone amidst the Trojans, he suffer
aught, although being brave, and there be great want [of him] to the
Greeks.”</p>
<p>Thus speaking, he led the way, and the godlike hero followed along with
him. Then they found Ulysses, dear to Jove; and around him followed the
Trojans, like tawny jackals round an antlered stag when wounded in the
mountains, which a man hath stricken with an arrow from the bowstring.
Him indeed, flying, it escapes on its feet, as long as the blood is
warm, and its knees have the power of motion. But when the swift arrow
hath subdued it, the raw-devouring jackals destroy it in a shady grove
among the mountains. Chance, however, brings thither the destructive
lion: the jackals then fly in terror, and he devours. So at that time
followed the Trojans, numerous and brave, round warlike, crafty Ulysses;
but the hero, rushing on with his spear, warded off the merciless day.
Then Ajax came near, bearing his shield, like a tower, and stood beside
him; and the Trojans fled, terrified, different ways. In the meantime
warlike Menelaus, taking him by the hand, withdrew [him] from the
throng, till his attendant drove his horses near. But Ajax, springing
upon the Trojans, slew Doryclus, son of Priam, an illegitimate son; and
next wounded Pandocus. Lysander he wounded, and Pyrasus, and Pylartes.
And as when an overflowing river comes down on the plain, a torrent from
the mountains, accompanied by the shower of Jove, and bears along with
it many dry oaks and many pines, and casts forth the swollen torrent
into the sea; so illustrious Ajax, routing [them], pursued [them] along
the plain, slaughtering both horses and men. Nor as yet had Hector heard
it; for he was fighting on the left of the battle, on the banks of the
river Scamander; for there chiefly fell the heads of men, and an
inextinguishable clamour had arisen around mighty Nestor, and warlike
Idomeneus. Among these did Hector mingle, performing arduous deeds with
his spear and equestrian skill, and he was laying waste the phalanxes of
youths. Nevertheless the noble Greeks would not have retired from the
way, had not Paris, the husband of fair-haired Helen, disabled Machaon,
the shepherd of the people, performing prodigies of valour, wounding him
on the right shoulder with a triple-barbed arrow. For him then the
valour-breathing Greeks trembled, lest perchance they should slay him,
the battle giving way, and immediately Idomeneus addressed noble Nestor:</p>
<p>“O Neleian Nestor, great glory of the Greeks, come, ascend thy chariot,
and let Machaon mount beside thee; and direct thy solid-hoofed horses
with all speed towards the ships, for a medical man is equivalent to
many others, both to cut out arrows, and to apply mild remedies.” <span id="footnotetag378"/>

   with the notes of Almeloveen, and lib. vii. præf., where the
   chirurgical part of ancient medicine is amusingly discussed.</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, nor did the Gerenian knight Nestor disobey. Forthwith he
ascended his chariot, and Machaon, the son of Æsculapius, blameless
physician, mounted beside him; but he lashed on the steeds, and they
flew not unwillingly towards the hollow ships, for there it was
agreeable to their inclination [to go].</p>
<p>But Cebriones, sitting beside Hector, perceived the Trojans in
confusion, and addressed him in [these] words: “Hector, we two are
mingling here with the Greeks in the outskirt of evil-sounding battle,
whilst the other Trojans are thrown into confusion in crowds, both their
horses and themselves. Telamonian Ajax is routing them, for I know him
well, for around his shoulders he bears a broad shield. But let us also
direct our horses and chariot thither, where cavalry and infantry,
having engaged in the evil strife, are slaughtering each other, and
inextinguishable tumult hath arisen.”</p>
<p>Thus then having spoken, he lashed on the fair-maned steeds with his
shrill-cracking lash. But they, sensible of the stroke, speedily bore
the swift chariot through Trojans and Greeks, trampling on both corses
and shields. With blood the whole axletree was stained beneath, and the
rims around the chariot-seat, which the drops from the horses’ hoofs,
and from the wheel-tires, spattered. But he longed to enter the crowd of
heroes, and to break through, springing upon them. And he sent
destructive tumult upon the Greeks, and abstained very little from the
spear. Among the ranks of other men indeed he ranged with his spear, his
sword, and with huge stones; but he shunned the conflict of Telamonian
Ajax.</p>
<p>But lofty-throned Jove excited fear within Ajax, and he stood
confounded, and cast behind him his shield of seven bulls’ hides.
Panic-struck he retired, gazing on all sides like a wild beast, turning
to and fro, slowly moving knee after knee. As when dogs and rustic men
drive a ravening lion from the stall of oxen, who, keeping watch all
night, do not allow him to carry off the fat of their cattle, but he,
eager for their flesh, rushes on, but profits nought, for numerous
javelins fly against him from daring hands, and blazing torches, at
which he trembles, although furious; but in the morning he stalks away
with saddened mind: so Ajax, sad at heart, then retired, much against
his will, from the Trojans; for he feared for the ships of the Greeks.
And as when a stubborn ass, upon whose sides<span id="footnotetag379"/>

already been broken, entering in, browses on the tall crop, but the boys
still beat him with sticks, although their strength is but feeble, and
with difficulty drive him out, when he is satiated with food, so then at
length the magnanimous Trojans and far-summoned allies continually
followed Ajax, the mighty son of Telamon, striking the middle of his
shield with missile weapons. And Ajax, sometimes wheeling about, was
mindful of impetuous might, and checked the phalanxes of the
horse-breaking Trojans, but again he would turn himself to fly. But he
prevented all from advancing to the swift ships, whilst standing himself
between the Trojans and Greeks he raged impetuously. And spears hurled
against him from daring hands, stuck, some indeed in his ample shield,
and many, though eager to glut themselves with his flesh, stood fixed in
the ground between, before they could reach his fair skin.</p>

(return) </a> Such seems to be the force of ἀμϕίς.</p>
<p>Whom when Eurypylus, the illustrious son of Evæmon, perceived pressed
hard with many darts, advancing he stood beside him, and took aim with
his shining spear; and smote Apisaon, son of Phausias, shepherd of the
people, in the liver, under the diaphragm; and immediately relaxed his
limbs. And when godlike Alexander observed him stripping off the armour
of Apisaon, he instantly bent his bow against Eurypylus, and smote him
with an arrow upon the right thigh; and the reed was broken, and pained
his thigh. Then he fell back into the column of his companions, avoiding
fate, and shouting, he cried with a loud voice to the Greeks:</p>
<p>“O friends, leaders, and rulers over the Greeks, rallying, stand firm,
and ward off the merciless day from Ajax, who is hard pressed with
darts; nor do I think that he will escape from the dread-resounding
battle. But by all means stand firm round mighty Ajax, the son of
Telamon.”</p>
<p>So spake the wounded Eurypylus, and they stood very near him, resting
their shields upon their shoulders, and lifting up their spears. But
Ajax came to meet them, and turning about, stood firm, when he reached
the body of his comrades. Thus they indeed combated like blazing fire.</p>
<p>In the meantime the Neleian steeds, sweating, bore Nestor from the
battle, and conveyed Machaon, the shepherd of the people. And noble
Achilles, swift of foot, looking forth, beheld him; for he stood upon
the prow of his great ship, gazing at the severe labour and lamentable
rout. Straightway he addressed Patroclus, his companion, calling [to
him] from the ship; and he, hearing him within the tent, came forth,
like unto Mars: but it was the beginning of misfortune to him. Him first
the gallant son of Menœtius addressed: “Why dost thou call me, Achilles,
and what need hast thou of me?”</p>
<p>But him swift-footed Achilles answering, addressed: “Noble son of
Menœtius, most dear to my soul, soon I think that the Greeks will stand
round my knees entreating, for a necessity no longer tolerable invades
them. But go now, Patroclus, dear to Jove, ask Nestor what man this is
whom he is carrying wounded from the battle. Behind, indeed, he wholly
resembles Machaon, the son of Æsculapius, but I have not beheld the
countenance of the man: for the horses passed by me, hastening onward.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, and Patroclus was obedient to his dear comrade, and
hastened to run to the tents and ships of the Greeks.</p>
<p>But when they came to the tent of the son of Neleus, they themselves
descended to the fertile earth, and Eurymedon, the attendant of the old
man, unyoked the mares from the chariot; whilst they refreshed

they sat down upon couches. But for them fair-curled Hecamede prepared a

selected for him, because he surpassed all in counsel. First she set

from home, studded with golden nails. Its handles were four, and around
each were two golden pigeons feeding, and under it were two bottoms.
Another indeed would have removed it with difficulty from the table,
being full; but aged Nestor raised it without difficulty. In it the
woman, like unto the goddesses, had mixed for them Pramnian wine, and
grated over it a goat’s-milk cheese with a brazen rasp, and sprinkled
white flour upon it: then bade them drink, as soon as she had prepared
the potion. But when drinking they had removed parching thirst, they
amused themselves, addressing each other in conversation. And Patroclus
stood at the doors, a godlike hero.</p>

Eurypylus also has been wounded in the thigh with an arrow; and this
other have I lately brought from battle, smitten with an arrow from the
bowstring: yet Achilles, being brave, regards not the Greeks, nor pities
them. Does he wait until the swift ships near the sea, contrary to the
will of the Greeks, be consumed with the hostile fire, and we ourselves
be slain one after the other? For my strength is not as it formerly was
in my active members. Would that I were thus young, and my might was
firm, as when a contest took place between the Eleans and us, about the
driving away some oxen, when, driving away in reprisal, I slew
Itymoneus, the valiant son of Hypeirochus, who dwelt in Elis: for he,
defending his cattle, was smitten among the first by a javelin from my
hand, and there fell; and his rustic troops fled on every side. And we
drove from the plain a very great booty, fifty droves of oxen, as many
flocks of sheep, as many herds of swine, and as many broad herds of
goats, one hundred and fifty yellow steeds, all mares, and beneath many
there were colts. And these we drove within Neleian Pylus, at night
towards the city; but Neleus was delighted in his mind, because many
things had fallen to my lot, going as a young man to the war. But with
the appearing morn, heralds cried aloud for those to approach to whom a
debt was due in rich Elis; and the leading heroes of the Pylians
assembling, divided [the spoil], (because the Epeans owed a debt to
many); for we in Pylus, [being] few, were overwhelmed with evil. For the
Herculean might, coming in former years, did us mischief, and as many as
were bravest were slain. For we, the sons of illustrious Neleus, were
twelve; of whom I alone am left, but all the rest have perished. Elated
at these things, the brazen-mailed Epeans, insulting us, devised wicked
deeds. But the old man chose for himself a herd of cattle and a large
flock of sheep, selecting three hundred and their shepherds; for even
to him a great debt was due in rich Elis: four horses, victorious in the
race, with their chariots, which had gone for the prizes; for they were
about to run for a tripod; but Augeas, king of men, detained them there,
and dismissed the charioteer, grieved on account of his steeds. At which
words and deeds the old man, being wroth, chose out for himself mighty
numbers, and gave the rest to the people to divide, that no one might go
away defrauded by him of his just proportion. We indeed accomplished
each of these things, and were performing sacrifices to the gods through
the city, when on the third day they all came at once, both the citizens
themselves and their solid-hoofed steeds, in full force: and with them
were armed the two Molions, being still youths, nor as yet very skilled
in impetuous might. There is a certain city, a lofty hill, Thryoëssa,
far away at the Alpheus, the last of sandy Pylus; this they invested,
eager to overthrow it. But when they had crossed the whole plain,
Minerva, hastening from Olympus, came to us by night as a messenger,
that we should be armed; nor did she assemble an unwilling people at
Pylus, but one very eager to fight. Still Neieus would not allow me to
be armed, but concealed my horses, for he said that I was not at all
acquainted with warlike deeds. Yet even thus was I conspicuous amongst
our cavalry, even although being on foot; for thus did Minerva conduct
me to battle. There is a certain river, Minyeïus, emptying itself into
the sea near Arena, where we, the Pylian horsemen, awaited divine Morn,
whilst the swarms of infantry poured in. Thence in full force, equipped
in armour, we came at mid-day to the sacred stream of Alpheus. There
having offered fair victims to almighty Jove, a bull to the Alpheus, and
a bull to Neptune, but an untrained heifer to blue-eyed Minerva, we then
took supper through the army by troops; and we each slept in our arms
along the river’s stream. In the meantime the magnanimous Epeans stood
around, desirous to lay waste the city; but a mighty work of Mars first
appeared to them: for as soon as the splendid sun was elevated above the
earth, we were engaged in the battle, praying to Jove and to Minerva.
But when now the battle of the Pylians and Eleans began, I first slew a
man, the warrior Molion, and bore away his solid-hoofed steeds: he was
the son-in-law of Augeas, and possessed his eldest daughter,
yellow-haired Agamede, who well understood as many drugs as the wide
earth nourishes. Him advancing against [me], I smote with my brazen
spear. He fell in the dust, and springing into his chariot, I then stood
among the foremost combatants; but the magnanimous Epeans fled
terrified in different directions when they beheld the hero fallen, the
leader of their cavalry, he who was the best to fight. But I rushed upon
them like unto a black whirlwind; and I took fifty chariots, and in each
two men bit the ground with their teeth, vanquished by my spear. And now
indeed I should have slain the youthful Molions, the sons<span id="footnotetag385"/>

had not their sire, wide-ruling Neptune, covering them with a thick
haze, preserved them from the war. Then Jove delivered into the hands of
the Pylians great strength, for so long did we follow them through the
long<span id="footnotetag386"/>

he had driven our horses to Buprasium, fertile in wheat, to the rock
Olenia and Alesium, where it is called Colone: whence Minerva turned
back the people. Then having killed the last man, I left him; but the
Greeks guided back their swift steeds from Buprasium to Pylus; and all
gave glory to Jove, of the gods, and to Nestor, of men. Thus was I, as
sure as ever I existed, among men: but Achilles will enjoy his valour
alone: surely I think that he will hereafter greatly lament, when the
people have bitterly perished. O my friend, Menœtius did assuredly thus
command thee on that day when he sent thee from Phthia to Agamemnon. For
we being both within, I and noble Ulysses, distinctly heard all things
in the halls, as he charged you: but we were come to the well-inhabited
palace of Peleus, collecting an army through fertile Greece. There then
we found the hero Menœtius within, as well as thee, and Achilles
besides; but the aged horseman, Peleus, was burning the fat thighs of an
ox to thunder-rejoicing Jove, within the enclosure<span id="footnotetag387"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-11.htm.html#footnote387" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">387</sup></a> of his palace,
and held a golden cup, pouring the dark wine over the blazing sacrifice.
Both of you were then employed about the flesh of the ox, whilst we
stood in the vestibule; but Achilles, astonished, leaped up, and led us
in, taking us by the hand, and bade us be seated: and he set in order
before us the offerings of hospitality which are proper for guests. But
when we were satiated with eating and drinking, I began discourse,
exhorting you to follow along with us. Ye were both very willing, and
they both commanded you many things. Aged Peleus in the first place
directed his son Achilles ever to be the bravest, and to be conspicuous
above others; but to thee again Menœtius, the son of Actor, thus gave
charge: ‘My son, Achilles indeed is superior in birth; but thou art the
elder. And he is much superior in strength: but still do thou frequently
suggest to him proper advice, and admonish and direct him, and he will
surely be obedient in what is for [his own] good.’ Thus did the old man
command thee; but thou art forgetful: but even now do thou mention
these things to warlike Achilles, if perchance he may be obedient. Who
knows if, advising him, thou mayest, with the gods’ assistance, arouse
his mind? For the admonition of a friend is good. But if within his mind
he avoid some prophecy, and his venerable mother has told him anything
from Jove, let him at least send thee forth; and with thee let the other
forces of the Myrmidons follow, if indeed thou mayest be some aid to the
Greeks. Let him likewise give his beautiful armour to thee, to be borne
into battle, if perchance the Trojans, assimilating thee to him, may
abstain from the conflict, and the warlike sons of the Greeks, already
afflicted, may respire; and there be a little respite from
fighting.<span id="footnotetag388"/>

<p>Thus he spake, and he aroused the spirit within his breast; and he
hastened to run to the ships to Achilles, the grandson of Æacus. But
when now Patroclus, running, arrived at the ships of godlike Ulysses,
where were their forum and seat of justice, and there the altars of
their gods also were erected, there Eurypylus, the noble son of Evæmon,
wounded with an arrow in the thigh, limping from the battle, met him.
Down his back ran the copious sweat from his shoulders and head, and
from the grievous wound oozed the black blood; nevertheless his mind was
firm. Seeing him, the gallant son of Menœtius pitied him, and, grieving,
spoke winged words:</p>
<p>“Alas! unhappy men, leaders and rulers over the Greeks, are ye then thus
destined, far away from your friends and native land, to satiate the
swift dogs at Troy with your white fat? But come, tell me this, O
Jove-nurtured hero, Eurypylus, will the Greeks still at all sustain
mighty Hector, or will they now be destroyed, subdued by his spear?”</p>
<p>But him prudent Eurypylus in turn addressed: “No longer, Jove-nurtured
Patroclus, will there be aid for the Greeks, but they will fall back
upon the black ships. For already all, as many as were once bravest, lie
at the ships, stricken or wounded by the hands of the Trojans, whose
strength ever increases. But do thou now, indeed, save me, leading me to
my black ship; and cut out the arrow from my thigh, and wash the black
blood<span id="footnotetag389"/>

salubrious, which they say thou wert taught by Achilles, whom Chiron
instructed, the most just of the Centaurs. For the physicians,
Podalirius and Machaon, the one, I think, having a wound, lies at the
tents, and himself in want of a faultless physician, and the other
awaits the sharp battle of the Trojans upon the plain.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote389"/><b>Footnote 389:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-11.htm.html#footnotetag389" class="pginternal">
(return) </a> Cf. Virg. Æn. x. 834: “Vulnera siccabat lymphis.”
   The manner in which this was done is described by Celsus, v. 26:
   “Si profusionem timemus, siccis lineamentis vulnus implendum est,
   supraque imponenda gpongia ex aqua frigida expressa, ac manu
   super comprimenda.” Cf. Athen. ii. 4.</p>
<p>But him again the brave son of Menœtius addressed: “How then will these
things turn out? What shall we do, O hero Eurypylus? I go that I may
deliver a message to warlike Achilles, with which venerable Nestor,
guardian of the Greeks, has intrusted me: but even thus I cannot neglect
thee, afflicted.”</p>
<p>He said, and having laid hold of the shepherd of the people under his
breast, bore him to the tent, and his attendant, when he saw him, spread
under him bulls’ hides. There [Patroclus] laying him at length, cut out
with a knife the bitter, sharp arrow from his thigh, and washed the
black blood from it with warm water. Then he applied a bitter,
pain-assuaging root, rubbing it in his hands, which checked all his
pangs: the wound, indeed, was dried up, and the bleeding ceased.</p>
