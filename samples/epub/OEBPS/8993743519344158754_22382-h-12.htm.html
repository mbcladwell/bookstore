<h2>BOOK THE TWELFTH.</h2>
<h4 id="pgepubid00030">ARGUMENT.</h4>
<p>The Trojans assail the rampart, and Hector, despite an omen, which
Polydamas interprets unfavourably, attacks and forces the gate, and
opens a way to the ships.</p>
<p class="p2">
Thus then at the tents the valiant son of Menœtius was healing the
wounded Eurypylus: but the Greeks and Trojans kept fighting in masses;
nor was the ditch of the Greeks destined to prove a barrier any longer,
and the wide wall from above, which they had erected in defence of the
ships; but they had drawn a foss around (nor had they given splendid
hecatombs to the gods); that it enclosing within, might defend the swift
ships and the great booty. But it was built against the will of the
immortal gods, therefore it remained not perfect for any long
period.<span id="footnotetag390"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-12.htm.html#footnote390" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">390</sup></a> As long as Hector was alive, and Achilles indignant, and
the city of king Priam unravaged, so long was the mighty wall of the
Greeks firm. But when all the bravest of the Trojans were dead, and many
of the Greeks were subdued, but others left surviving, when in the tenth
year the city of Priam was sacked, and the Greeks went in their ships to
their dear fatherland; then at length Neptune and Apollo took counsel to
demolish the wall, introducing the strength of rivers, as many as flow
into the sea from the Idæan mountains, both the Rhesus and the
Heptaporus, the Caresus and the Rhodius, the Granicus and the Æsepus,
the divine Scamander and the Simoïs, where many shields and helmets fell
in the dust, and the race of demigod men. The mouths of all these Phœbus
Apollo turned to the same spot, and for nine days he directed their
streams against the wall; and Jove in the meantime rained continually,
that he might the sooner render the walls overwhelmed by the sea. But
the Earth-shaker [Neptune] himself, holding the trident in his hands,
led them on; and then dispersed among the billows all the foundations of
beams and stones which the Greeks had laid with toil. And he made [all]
level along the rapid Hellespont, and again covered the vast shore with
sands, having demolished the wall: but then he turned the rivers to go
back into their own channels, in which they had formerly poured their
sweet-flowing water.<span id="footnotetag391"/>

there the ranks of men give way: so Hector, going through the crowd,
rolled along, inciting his companions to cross the trench. Nor did the

overhanging brinks stood round it on both sides, and beneath it was
fortified with sharp palisades, which the sons of the Greeks had fixed,
close-set and large, as a defence against hostile men. There a horse,
drawing a swift-rolling chariot, could not readily enter, but the
infantry eagerly desired it, if they could accomplish it. Then indeed
Polydamas, standing near, addressed daring Hector:</p>

<p>“Hector, and ye other leaders of the Trojans, and allies, unwisely do we
drive our fleet steeds through the trench, which is very difficult to
pass; since sharp palisades stand in it, and near them is the wall of
the Greeks. Wherefore it is by no means possible for the cavalry to
descend, or to fight, for it is a narrow place, where I think they would
be wounded. For if indeed lofty-thundering Jove, designing evil,
destroys the Greeks, but wishes to assist the Trojans, certainly I would
wish this to take place even immediately, that the Greeks perish here
inglorious, away from Argos. If, however, they rally, and a repulse from
the ships take place, and we be entangled in the dug trench, I do not
suppose that then even a messenger will return back to the city from the
Greeks. But come, let us all be persuaded as I shall advise. Let the
servants keep our horses at the trench, and let us, all on foot, clad in
armour, follow Hector in a close body; but the Greeks will not withstand
us, if indeed the end of destruction hang over them.”</p>
<p>Thus spake Polydamas; but the safe counsel pleased Hector; and
immediately he leaped with his armour from his chariot on the ground.
Nor did the other Trojans assemble on horseback, but dismounting, they
rushed on, when they beheld noble Hector. Then each commanded his own
charioteer to rein his steeds in good order there at the trench, and
they, separating, drawing themselves up, and being arranged in five
columns, followed along with their leaders. Some then went with Hector
and illustrious Polydamas, who were most numerous and brave, and who
were most resolutely desirous, having broken down the wall, to fight at
the hollow ships. And Cebriones followed as a third; for Hector left
another, inferior to Cebriones, with his chariot. Others Paris
commanded, and Alcathous, and Agenor. The third band Helenus and godlike
Deïphobus, two sons of Priam; but the third [commander] was the hero
Asius, Asius son of Hyrtacus, whom fiery, tall steeds brought from
Arisba, from the river Selleïs. But the fourth, Æneas, the brave son of
Anchises, led; along with him were the two sons of Antenor, Archilochus
and Acamas, well skilled in every kind of fight. But Sarpedon commanded
the illustrious allies, and chose to himself Glaucus and warlike
Asteropæus; for they appeared to him, next to himself decidedly the
bravest of the rest: for he, indeed, excelled among all. When they then
had fitted each other together<span id="footnotetag396"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-12.htm.html#footnote396" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">396</sup></a> with interlaced ox-hide bucklers,
they advanced, full of courage, direct against the Greeks, nor expected
that they would sustain them, but that they would fall in flight into
their black ships.</p>
<p>Then the other Trojans and far-summoned allies obeyed the counsel of
blameless Polydamas; but Asius, son of Hyrtacus, leader of heroes, was
unwilling to relinquish his horses and attendant charioteer, but with
them advanced to the swift ships,—foolish! Nor was he destined to
return again, borne on his steeds and chariot from the ships to
wind-swept Ilium, having avoided evil destiny. For him unlucky fate
first encircled from the spear of Idomeneus, the illustrious son of
Deucalion. For he rushed towards the left of the ships, by the way in
which the Greeks were returning from the plain with their horses and
chariots. Thither he drove his horses and his chariot, nor did he find
the gates closed<span id="footnotetag397"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-12.htm.html#footnote397" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">397</sup></a> in the portal, or the long bar up, but the men
held them wide open, that they might safely receive at the ships any of
their companions flying from the battle. He designedly guided his steeds
right onward in that way, and [his troops], shrilly shouting, followed
along with him; for they supposed that the Greeks could no longer
sustain them, but would fall in flight into the black ships—fools! for
at the gates they found two very brave heroes, the magnanimous sons of
the warlike Lapithæ, the one the son of Pirithous, gallant Polypœtes,
the other Leonteus, equal to man-slaughtering Mars. These two then stood
before the lofty gates, as tall oaks on the mountains, which abide the
wind and rain at all seasons, remaining firmly fixed by their great and
wide-spreading roots; so they too, trusting to their hands and strength,
awaited mighty Asius coming on, nor fled. But the troops, lifting high
their well-seasoned bucklers, advanced with loud shouting directly
towards the well-built wall, round their king Asius, and Iämenus, and
Orestes, Acamas, the son of Asius, Thoon, and Œnomäus. Hitherto indeed
these, remaining within, were exhorting the well-armed Greeks to fight
for the ships; but when they perceived the Trojans rushing against the
wall, and confusion and flight of the Greeks arose, both darting out,
fought before the gates, like unto wild boars, which await the
approaching tumult of men and dogs in the mountains, and, advancing
obliquely to the attack, break down the wood around them, cutting it to
the root; and a gnashing of teeth arises from beneath, till some one,
having taken aim, deprive them of life. So resounded the shining brass
upon their breasts, smitten in front, for very valiantly they fought,
trusting to the troops above, and to their own valour. But they hurled
stones down from the well-built towers, defending themselves, their
tents, and the swift-voyaging ships. And as snow-flakes fall upon the
earth, which the violent wind, having disturbed the shady clouds, pours
down thick upon the fertile soil; thus poured the weapons from the hands
as well of the Greeks as of the Trojans; and the helmets and bossy
shields, smitten with large stones, sounded drily around. Then indeed
Asius, son of Hyrtacus, groaned, and smote both his thighs, and
indignant exclaimed:</p>
<p>“Father Jove, surely now at least thou also hast become utterly
deceitful; for I did not expect that the Grecian heroes would abide our
strength and invincible hands. But they, as wasps flexible<span id="footnotetag398"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-12.htm.html#footnote398" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">398</sup></a> in the
middle, and bees, [which] make their dwellings in a rugged path, nor
quit their hollow mansion; but awaiting the huntsmen, fight for their
offspring; so are these unwilling to retire from the gates, though being
only two, until they be either killed or taken.”</p>

</div></div>
<p>But the Lapithæ began the battle and contest. Then the son of Pirithous,
brave Polypœtes, smote Damasus with his spear, through his
brazen-cheeked helmet; nor did the brazen casque withstand, but the
brazen blade burst quite through the bone, and all the brain within was
shattered. Thus he subdued him, rushing on, and afterwards he slew Pylon
and Ormenus. And Leonteus, a branch of Mars, wounded Hippomachus, the
son of Antimachus, with his spear, striking him at the belt. Next,
drawing his sharp sword from the sheath, he, rushing through the crowd,
smote Antiphates first, hand to hand, and he was dashed on his back to
the ground; then Menon and Iämenus, and Orestes, all one over another he
brought to the fertile earth.</p>
<p>Whilst they were stripping off their glittering armour, those youths,
meantime, who were most numerous and most brave, and who were most eager
to break down the wall, and burn the ships with fire, followed Polydamas
and Hector, and they anxiously deliberated, standing at the trench. For
an augury had appeared on the left to them while eager to cross, a
high-flying eagle dividing the people,<span id="footnotetag400"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-12.htm.html#footnote400" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">400</sup></a> bearing in his talons a
monstrous blood-stained serpent, alive, still panting; nor was it yet
forgetful of fighting; for, while holding it, writhing backwards, it
wounded him upon the breast near the neck; but he let it drop from him
to the ground, afflicted with anguish, and threw it into the midst of
the crowd, and, flapping his wings, he fled away with the breeze of the
wind. And the Trojans shuddered as they beheld the spotted serpent lying
in the midst, a prodigy of ægis-bearing Jove. Then Polydamas, standing
near, addressed gallant Hector:</p>
<p>“Hector, somehow or other thou art ever chiding me in the assemblies,
although proposing good counsels; because it is by no means becoming for
a man, being a citizen, to harangue contrary to thee, either in council
or at any time in war; but ever to increase thy authority. Yet will I
again speak as appears to me to be best. Let us not go about to fight
with the Greeks for their ships; for thus do I think it will end, as
sure as this augury has come to the Trojans desiring to cross, the
high-flying eagle upon the left dividing the army, bearing in its talons
a huge blood-stained serpent, [still] living; but presently it dropped
it, before it reached its dear home, nor succeeded in carrying it to
give it to its young: so we, if even we shall with great force break
through the gates and wall of the Greeks, and the Greeks shall give
way,—not in order shall we return by the same way from the ships: for
we shall leave many Trojans, whom the Greeks, fighting for the ships,
will subdue with the brass. Thus indeed would the diviner, who truly
kens omens in his mind, interpret, and the people would obey him.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote400"/><b>Footnote 400:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-12.htm.html#footnotetag400" class="pginternal">

   13), and xii. 247, sqq. The event of the Trojan war proved that
   Polydamas was right in his interpretation.</p>
<p>But him sternly regarding, crest-tossing Hector thus addressed: “O
Polydamas, thou dost not say things agreeable to me: besides, thou
knowest how to devise other counsel better than this. If, however, thou
really speakest this with seriousness, then truly have the gods
destroyed thy judgment from thee, who advisest me to be forgetful of the
counsels of lofty-thundering Jove, which he hath himself undertaken for
me, and confirmed. And thou exhortest me to obey the wing-expanding
birds; which I very little regard, nor do I care for them, whether they
fly to the right towards the Morn and the Sun, or to the left towards
the darkening west; but let us obey the will of mighty Jove, who rules
over all mortals and immortals. There is one augury, the best, to fight
for our country.<span id="footnotetag401"/>

although all the rest of us should perish round the ships of the Greeks,
there is no fear that thou wilt perish, for thy heart is not persevering
in the fight, nor warlike. But if thou darest to abstain from the
combat, or dissuading, dost avert another from the battle, immediately
stricken by my spear, shalt thou lose thy life.”</p>
<p>Thus then having spoken, he led the way, but they followed him with an
immense clamour. Then thunder-delighting Jove raised a storm of wind
from the Idæan mountains, which bore the dust directly towards the
ships; moreover, he weakened the courage of the Greeks, but bestowed
glory upon the Trojans and Hector: so that, relying upon his prodigies,
and [their own] strength, they endeavoured to break through the mighty
wall of the Greeks. They tore down the niched battlements of the towers,
and demolished the breast-works,<span id="footnotetag402"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-12.htm.html#footnote402" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">402</sup></a> and with levers they upheaved the
projecting buttresses, which the Greeks had planted first in the earth,
as supporters of the towers. These then they tore down, and hoped to
break through the wall of the Greeks.</p>
<p>Yet did not the Greeks retire as yet from the way; but fencing up the
embrazures with their ox-hide shields, they wounded from behind them the
enemy coming up under the wall. And both the Ajaces ranged in every
direction upon the towers, cheering on, rousing the valour of the
Greeks. One [they addressed]<span id="footnotetag403"/>

<p>“O friends, whoever of the Greeks is excelling, or moderate, or inferior
(since all men are not alike in war), now is there work for all; and ye
yourselves, I ween, know this. Let not any one be turned back towards
the ships, hearing the threatener [Hector], but advance onwards, and
exhort each other, if perchance Olympic Jove, the darter of lightning,
may grant that, having repulsed the conflict, we may pursue the enemy to
the city.”</p>
<p>Thus they, shouting in front, cheered on the attack of the Greeks. But
of them—as when frequent flakes of snow fall upon a winter’s day, when
provident Jove has begun to snow, displaying his weapons in the sight of
men, and, having lulled the winds, pours it down incessantly, till he
covers the tops and highest peaks of the lofty mountains, and the lotus
plains and rich husbandry of men: and likewise it is poured out upon the
havens and shores of the hoary sea; but the approaching wave restrains
its progress, whilst all other things are covered beneath it, when the
shower of Jove comes down heavily; so flew the frequent stones from
those hurling on both sides, some indeed towards the Trojans, and others
from the Trojans towards the Greeks. And along the whole wall a tumult
arose.</p>
<p>Yet never would the Trojans and illustrious Hector have burst open the
gates of the wall, and the long bolt, had not provident Jove urged on
his son, Sarpedon, against the Greeks, like a lion against
crooked-horned oxen. But he immediately held before him his shield,
equal on all sides, beautiful, brazen, plated; which the brazier indeed
had plated over, and underneath had sewed together thick bulls’ hides,
with successive golden wires round its orb. He then, holding this before
him, advanced, brandishing two spears, like a lion reared in the
mountains, which hath been long in want of flesh, and whose valiant mind
impels him to go even to the well-fenced fold, about to make an attempt
upon the sheep. And although he there find the shepherds keeping watch
about their flocks with dogs and spears, still he cannot bear to be
driven away, without having made trial of the fold, but, springing in,
he either carries [one] off, or is himself wounded among the first by a
javelin from a quick hand. Thus then did his mind impel godlike Sarpedon
to attack the wall, and to burst through the barriers; and instantly he
addressed Glaucus, son of Hippolochus:</p>
<p>“Glaucus,<span id="footnotetag404"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-12.htm.html#footnote404" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">404</sup></a> why are we especially honoured in Lycia, both with the
[first] seat in banquet, and with full goblets, and why do all look to
us as to gods? Why do we also possess a great and beautiful enclosure of
the vine-bearing and corn-bearing land on the banks of Xanthus? Now,
therefore, it behoves us, advancing among the foremost Lycians, to stand
firm, and to bear the brunt of the raging fight; so that some one of the
closely-armed Lycians may say, ‘By no means inglorious do our kings
govern Lycia, and eat the fat sheep, and [drink]<span id="footnotetag405"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-12.htm.html#footnote405" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">405</sup></a> the choice sweet
wine; but their valour likewise is excelling, because they fight among
the foremost Lycians.’ O dear friend, if indeed, by escaping from this
war, we were destined to be ever free from old age, and immortal,
neither would I combat myself in the van, nor send thee into the
glorious battle. But now—for of a truth ten thousand Fates of death
press upon us, which it is not possible for a mortal to escape or
avoid—let us on: either we shall give glory to some one, or some one to
us.”</p>
<p>Thus he spake, nor did Glaucus turn aside or disobey, but both advanced
straight forward, leading a numerous band of Lycians. But Menestheus,
the son of Peteus, beholding them, shuddered, for they were advancing
towards his company, bearing destruction. He looked round along the line
of the Greeks, if he might see any of the leaders who could ward off the
fight from his companions, and perceived the two Ajaces, insatiable of
war, standing, and Teucer, lately come from his tent, near at hand. Yet
was it not possible for him to be heard when shouting, so great was the
din; and the crash of stricken shields, and of horse-hair crested
helmets, and of the gates, reached to heaven. For they had assailed
all,<span id="footnotetag406"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-12.htm.html#footnote406" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">406</sup></a> and they, standing beside them, endeavoured to enter, bursting
them open by force. But immediately he despatched the herald Thoötes to
Ajax:</p>

<p>“Go, noble Thoötes, running, call Ajax, rather indeed both: for this
would be by far the best of all, since in a short while heavy
destruction will arise here. For so vigorously do the leaders of the
Lycians press on, who even before were impetuous in the sharp contest.
If, however, labour and contest have arisen to them there, at least let
brave Telamonian Ajax come, and with him let Teucer follow, well skilled
in archery.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, nor did the herald, having heard him, disobey, but he
hastened to run along the wall of the brazen-mailed Greeks, and
proceeding, he stood beside the Ajaces and immediately addressed them:</p>
<p>“Ye Ajaces, leaders of the brazen-mailed Greeks, the beloved son of
Jove-nourished Peteus adjures you to come thither, that ye may
participate in his toil, though for a short time. Both indeed in
preference, for this would be by far the best of all things, since soon
will heavy destruction arise there. For so vigorously do the leaders of
the Lycians press on, who even before were impetuous in the sharp
contest. But if here also war and contest have arisen, at least let
brave Telamonian Ajax come alone, and with him let Teucer follow, well
skilled in archery.”</p>
<p>Thus he spake, nor did mighty Telamonian Ajax disobey. Instantly he
addressed to the son of Oïleus winged words:</p>
<p>“Ajax, do thou and gallant Lycomedes, standing here, incite the Greeks
to fight bravely, whilst I go thither and oppose the battle; but I will
return again instantly, after I shall have assisted them.”</p>
<p>Thus then having spoken, Telamonian Ajax departed, and with him went
Teucer, his brother, sprung from the same father; and Pandion, along
with them, carried the bent bow of Teucer. As soon as they reached the
tower of magnanimous Menestheus, going within the wall (for they came to
[their friends] being hard pressed: and the brave leaders and chiefs of
the Lycians were mounting upon the breast-works like unto a dark
whirlwind), but they engaged to fight in opposition, and a clamour
arose. Telamonian Ajax first slew a man, the companion of Sarpedon,
magnanimous Epicles, striking him with a rugged stone, which, mighty in
size, lay highest up against a pinnacle within the wall. Not easily
would a man support it with both hands, such as mortals now are, not
although being very youthful; but he, raising it aloft, hurled it, and
burst the four-coned helmet, and along with it crushed all the bones of
the skull: but he, like unto a diver, fell from the lofty tower, and
life deserted his bones. Teucer likewise with a shaft wounded Glaucus,
the brave son of Hippolochus, as he was rushing on, against the lofty
wall, in a part where he perceived his arm naked; and made him cease
from combat. But he sprang back from the wall, concealing himself, that
none of the Greeks might perceive him wounded, and insult him with
words. Then grief came upon Sarpedon on account of Glaucus departing,
as soon as he observed it; though he nevertheless was not neglectful of
the contest: but he taking aim, wounded Alcmaon, son of Thestor, with
his spear, and extracted the spear; but he. following the weapon, fell
prone, and his armour, variously decked with brass, resounded upon him.
Sarpedon then seizing the buttress with his sturdy hands, pulled, and it
all followed entirely; but the wall was stripped away from above, and he
formed a way for many. Then Ajax and Teucer aiming at him together, the
one smote him with an arrow in the splendid belt of his mortal-girding
shield, around his breast; but Jove averted the fate from his son, that
he might not be slain at the sterns of the ships. But Ajax, springing
upon him, struck his shield, and pierced him quite through with his
spear, and forcibly checked him eager. And then he fell back for a
little from the buttress, but did not altogether retreat, because his
spirit hoped to bear off glory. And turning round, he encouraged the
godlike Lycians:</p>
<p>“O Lycians, why are ye thus remiss in your impetuous force? It is
difficult for me, although being brave, having alone burst through, to
form a way to the ships. But follow along with me; for the labour of the
greater number is better.”</p>
<p>Thus he spake; and they, reverencing the exhortation of their king,
pressed on with more alacrity round their counsel-giving king. And the
Greeks, on the other side, strengthened their phalanxes within the wall,
because a great work presented itself to them. For neither could the
gallant Lycians, bursting through the wall of the Greeks, make their way
to the ships, nor could the warlike Greeks repulse the Lycians from the
wall, since first they approached it. But as two men, holding measures
in their hands, dispute, in a common field,<span id="footnotetag407"/>

boundaries, who in a small space contend for their equitable right; thus
did the buttresses separate these [warriors], and, for them, each smote
the well-rounded ox-hide shields around each other’s breasts, and the
light bucklers of each other. And many were wounded upon the body with
the merciless brass, whether the back of any combatant, averted, was
laid bare, and many right through the shield itself. Everywhere the
towers and buttresses were sprinkled, on both sides, with the blood of
heroes, from the Trojans and the Greeks. Yet not even thus could they
cause a flight of the Greeks, but they held themselves, as a just woman,
who labours with her hands, does the scales,<span id="footnotetag408"/>

weight and the wool, draws them on either side to equalize them, that
she may procure a scanty pittance for the support of her children. Thus
equally was their battle and war extended, before the time when Jove
gave superior glory to Hector, the son of Priam, who first leaped within
the wall of the Greeks, and shouted with a penetrating voice, calling
out to the Trojans:</p>
<p>“Push on, ye horse-breaking Trojans, burst through the wall of the
Greeks, and hurl the fiercely-blazing fire against the ships.”</p>
<p>Thus he spake, cheering them on; but they all heard him with their ears,
and rushed against the wall in great numbers, and then mounted the
battlements, carrying their pointed spears. But Hector seizing it, took
up a stone, which stood before the gates, widening out at the base,<span id="footnotetag409"/>

but sharp above; which two men, the strongest of the people, such as
mortals now are, could not easily raise from the ground upon a waggon.
He, however, brandished it easily and alone, because the son of wise
Saturn had rendered it light to him.</p>

<p>As when a shepherd without difficulty carries the fleece of a male
sheep, taking it in either hand, and but a small weight oppresses him;
so Hector, raising the stone, bore it right against the beams which
strengthened the closely-jointed gates, double and lofty; but two
cross-bars secured them within, and one key fitted them. But advancing,
he stood very near, and exerting his strength, struck them in the
middle, standing with his legs wide asunder, that the blow of the weapon
might not be weak. And he tore away both hinges, and the stone fell
within with a great weight; and the gates crashed around; nor did the
bars withstand it, but the beams were rent asunder in different
directions by the impulse of the stone. There illustrious Hector rushed
in, in aspect like unto the dreadful night; and he glittered in
terrible brass, with which he was girt around his body. And he held two
spears in his hands, nor could any one, opposing, restrain him, except
the gods, after he had leaped within the gates; but his eyes gleamed
with fire. And turning to the crowd, he cheered on the Trojans to ascend
the wall, and they obeyed him encouraging. Straightway indeed some
crossed the wall, and others were poured in through the well-wrought
gates, but the Greeks were routed towards the hollow barks, and an
