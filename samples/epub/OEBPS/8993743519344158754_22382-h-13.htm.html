<h2>BOOK THE THIRTEENTH.</h2>
<h4 id="pgepubid00032">ARGUMENT.</h4>
<p>Neptune engages on the Grecian side, and the battle proceeds. Deïphobus
is repulsed by Meriones. Teucer kills Imbrius, and Hector Amphimachus.
Neptune, assuming the likeness of Thoas, exhorts Idomeneus, who goes
forth with Meriones to battle, when the former slays Othryoneus and
Asius. Deïphobus attacks Idomeneus, but misses him, and slays Hypsenor.
Idomeneus slays Alcathous, over whose body a sharp contest ensues.</p>
<p class="p2">
But after Jove, then, had brought the Trojans and Hector near the ships,
he left them to endure labour and toil at them incessantly; but he
himself turned back his shining eyes apart, looking towards the land of
the equestrian Thracians and the close-fighting Mysians, and the
illustrious Hippomolgi, milk-nourished, simple in living, and most just
men.<span id="footnotetag411"/>

(return) </a> Arrian, Exp. Alex. iv. p. 239, referring to this
   passage of Homer, observes, οἰκοῦσι δὲ ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ οὗτοι
   αὐτόνομοι, οὐχ ἥκιστα διὰ πενίαν τε καὶ δικαιότητα. Dionysius,
   Perieg. 309, seems, as Hill observes, to consider the name
   ἱππημολγοί as applicable not to one single clan, but to the whole
   of the Sarmatian nomads, milk being one of the principal articles
   of their diet, as among the Suevi (Cæsar, B.G. iv. 1), and the
   ancient Germans (id. vi. 22). Callimachus, Hymn iii., applies the
   epithet to the Cimmerians. The epithet ἀβίων (or ἀβιῶν=<i>bowless</i>,
   not living by archery: cf. Alberti on Hesych. t. i. pp. 17, 794)
   is involved in doubt, and the ancients themselves were uncertain
   whether to regard it as a proper name or an epithet. (Cf. Steph.
   Byz. s. v., p. 7, ed. Pined.; Villois on Apoll. Lex. p. 14;
   Duport, Gnom. Horn. p. 74, sqq.) It seems best to understand with
   Strabo, vii. p. 460, nations ἀπ' ὀλίγων εὐτελῶς ζὧντας. Knight
   wished to throw out these verses altogether, alleging that
   allusion is made in them to the discipline of Zamolxis, with
   which Homer must have been wholly unacquainted.</p>
<p>Nor did king Neptune keep a vain watch; for he sat aloft upon the
highest summit of the woody Thracian Samos, admiring the war and the
battle. For from thence all Ida was visible, and the city of Priam was
visible, and the ships of the Greeks. Then coming out of the sea, he sat
down, and he pitied the Greeks, subdued by the Trojans, and was very
indignant with Jove. But presently he descended down, from the rugged
mountain, rapidly advancing on foot, and the high hills and woods
trembled beneath the immortal feet of Neptune, advancing. Thrice indeed
he strode, advancing, and with the fourth step he reached Ægæ, his
destined goal. There distinguished mansions, golden, glittering, ever
incorruptible, were erected to him in the depths of the sea. Coming
thither, he yoked beneath his chariot the brazen-footed steeds, swiftly
flying, crested with golden manes. But he himself placed gold around his
person, took his golden lash, well wrought, and ascended his chariot. He
proceeded to drive over the billows, and the monsters of the deep<span id="footnotetag412"/>

sported beneath him on all sides from their recesses, nor were ignorant
of their king. For joy the sea separated; and they flew very rapidly,
nor was the brazen axle moist beneath. And his well-bounding steeds bore
him to the ships of the Greeks.</p>
<p>Now there is an ample cave<span id="footnotetag413"/>

Tenedos and rugged Imbrus. There earth-shaking Neptune stopped his
horses, loosing them from the chariot, and cast beside [them] ambrosial
fodder to eat. And round their feet he threw golden fetters,
irrefragable, indissoluble, that they might there steadily await their
king returning, but he departed towards the army of the Greeks.</p>

<p>The Trojans, however, in crowds, like unto a flame or a whirlwind,
followed Hector, the son of Priam, with insatiable ardour, shouting
loudly, and exclaiming; for they hoped to capture the ships of the
Greeks, and slay all the Greeks beside them. But earth-ruling,
earth-shaking Neptune, coming from the deep sea, aroused the Greeks,
assimilating his person and indefatigable voice to Calchas. The Ajaces
he first addressed, though themselves were earnest:</p>
<p>“Ye Ajaces, ye indeed, mindful of valour, not of direful flight, will
preserve the people of the Greeks. For in any other place, indeed, I do
not dread the audacious hands of the Trojans, who in great numbers have
surmounted the great wall, because the well-greaved Greeks will sustain
them all. But in that place I grievously fear lest we suffer any thing,
where infuriated Hector, like unto a flame, leads on who boasts to be
the son of almighty Jove. But may some of the gods thus put it in your
minds, that ye stand firmly yourselves, and exhort others; thus may ye
drive him, although impetuous, from the swift-sailing ships, even if
Jove himself excites him.”</p>
<p>He said, and earth-ruling Neptune, striking both with his sceptre,
filled them with violent might, and made their limbs light and their
feet and hands above. But he, like as a swift-winged hawk is impelled to
fly, which, lifted up from a rugged, lofty rock, has hastened to pursue
another bird over the plain; so darted earth-shaking Neptune from them.
But fleet Ajax, the son of Oïleus, recognized him first of the two, and
straightway addressed Ajax, the son of Telamon:</p>
<p>“O Ajax, since some one of the gods, who possess Olympus, likening
himself to the soothsayer, exhorts us to fight beside the ships (neither
is this Calchas, the prophesying augur; for I readily recognized the
traces of his feet and legs when departing; for the gods are easily
distinguished), even to myself, the soul within my bosom is more incited
to war and to fight, and my feet beneath and hands above eagerly desire
it.”</p>
<p>But him Telamonian Ajax answering, addressed: “So also to me are my
strong hands upon my spear eager, and my courage is aroused, and I am
hurried along by both my feet under me; and I eagerly long, even alone,
to combat with Hector, the son of Priam, insatiably raging.”</p>
<p>Thus they addressed these words to each other, joyful in the desire of
battle<span id="footnotetag414"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-13.htm.html#footnote414" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">414</sup></a> which the god had infused into their minds. In the meanwhile
the Earth-ruler (Neptune) aroused the Achæans in the rear, who were
recruiting their spirit at the swift ships; whose limbs were at the same
time relaxed with toilsome labour, and grief was arising in their minds,
beholding the Trojans, who with a tumult had surmounted the vast wall.
But beholding them, they poured forth tears from beneath their eyebrows,
for they expected not to escape destruction: but the Earth-shaker
intervening, easily aroused the brave phalanxes. To Teucer and Leius he
first came, exhorting them, and to the hero Peneleus, and Thoas, and
Deipyrus, and to Meriones and Antilochus, skilful in war. These he
encouraging, spoke winged words:</p>

<p>“O shame! Argives, young men, I trust that our ships will be preserved
by your fighting; but if ye be remiss in the destructive battle, the day
is now come [for us] to be subdued by the Trojans. Ye gods, surely I
behold with my eyes a great marvel, terrible, which I never expected
would be brought to pass, that the Trojans should approach our ships;
who formerly, like unto timid stags, which through the wood are the prey
of lynxes, pards, and wolves, foolishly straying about, weak, nor fit
for combat: so the Trojans formerly would not stand even for a little
against the might and prowess of the Greeks. But now, far away from the
city, they combat at the hollow ships, through the perverseness of our
general, and the indifference of the troops; who, disputing with him,
are unwilling to defend the swift ships, but are slain among them. Yet
although in reality the hero, the son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon,
be altogether in fault, in that he hath dishonoured the swift-footed son
of Peleus, still it is by no means our duty to be remiss in battle, but
let us the sooner repair [the mischief];<span id="footnotetag415"/>

easily appeased. But they by no means honourably remit your impetuous
valour, being all the bravest in the army: I indeed would not quarrel
with a man who should desist from combat, being unwarlike; but with you
I am indignant from my heart. O soft ones! surely will ye soon create
some greater evil by this inertness: but do each of you in his mind
ponder on the shame and reproach; for certainly a mighty contest hath
arisen. Now indeed brave Hector, good in the din of war, combats at the
ships, and hath burst through the gates and the long bar.”</p>

<p>Thus then Neptune, exhorting, aroused the Greeks. But round the two
Ajaces firm phalanxes stood, which not even Mars, coming amongst them,
would have found fault with, nor Minerva, the confounder of armies; for
the bravest selected awaited the Trojans and noble Hector; knitting
spear with spear, shield with shield,<span id="footnotetag416"/>

spears in the act of being hurled, were brandishing from their daring
hands, whilst they wished [to go] straight [against the enemy], and were
eager to fight. But the combined Trojans first made the attack, and
impetuous Hector first rushed against them: as a destructively-rolling
stone from a rock, which a wintry torrent drives down the brow, having
burst with a mighty shower the stays of the rugged rock, and bounding
along, it rolls, and the forest resounds beneath it: but straightway it
runs on uninterruptedly until it reach the plain, but then it rolls no
longer, though impelled; so Hector for a while threatened that he would
easily come as far as the sea, to the tents and ships of the Greeks,
slaughtering. But when now he met the firm phalanxes, he stopped, being
come into close contact; and the sons of the Greeks, opposing, repulsed
him from them, striking him with their swords and two-edged spears; but
retiring, he was compelled to withdraw; and he cried out shouting
audibly to the Trojans:</p>
<p>“Ye Trojans and Lycians, and close-fighting Dardanians, stand firm. Not
long will the Greeks withstand me, although they have drawn themselves
up in very dense array.<span id="footnotetag419"/>

<p>So saying, he aroused the might and courage of each. But Deïphobus, the
son of Priam, walked amongst them, high-minded, and he held his shield
equal on all sides before him, proceeding with light step, and advancing
under protection of his shield. Then Meriones took aim with his shining
spear, and struck him (nor did he miss) upon the bull’s-hide shield,
equal on all sides, which he did not pierce; for the long spear, far
before was broken at the socket. But Deïphobus held his bull’s-hide
shield far from him, for he dreaded in his mind the spear of warlike
Meriones; but that hero fell back into the column of his companions, for
he was grievously enraged on both accounts, both for [the loss] of the
victory, and of the spear which he had broken. Accordingly he proceeded
to pass by the tents and ships of the Greeks, to bring a long spear
which had been left in his tent; whilst the others fought, and a mighty
tumult arose.</p>
<p>Then Telamonian Teucer first slew a hero, the warrior Imbrius, son of
Mentor, rich in steeds; and he dwelt at Pedæum before the sons of the
Greeks arrived, and had married Medesicaste, the illegitimate daughter
of Priam. But when the equally-plied ships of the Greeks arrived, he
came back to Ilium, and excelled among the Trojans; and dwelt with
Priam, who honoured him equally with his sons. Him the son of Telamon
smote under the ear with his long javelin, and plucked out the spear;
but he indeed fell, like an ash, which, on the summit of a mountain
conspicuous from afar, cut down with a brazen axe, strews its tender
foliage on the earth. Thus he fell, and his armour, variegated with
brass, rang about him. Then Teucer rushed on, eager to strip him of his
armour; but Hector hurled his shining spear at him, hastening. He,
however, seeing it from the opposite side, avoided, by a small space,
the brazen spear; and [Hector] wounded with his javelin, on the breast,
Amphimachus, son of Cteas, the son of Actor, advancing to the battle;
and, falling, he gave a crash, and his arms rang upon him. Then Hector
rushed to tear from the head of magnanimous Amphimachus the helmet
fitted to his temples, but Ajax hurled with his shining spear at Hector,
rushing on. Yet it never reached his body, for he was protected all over
with terrible brass; but he smote him upon the boss of the shield, and
repulsed him with great violence; and he retired from both bodies, and
the Greeks drew them away. Then Stichius and noble Menestheus, the
leaders of the Athenians, carried Amphimachus to the army of the Greeks,
but the two Ajaces, eager for impetuous combat, [carried] Imbrius. As
two lions bear a goat through the thick copse-wood, snatching it from
the sharp-toothed dogs, holding it high above the earth in their jaws;
so the two warriors, the Ajaces, holding him [Imbrius] aloft, stripped
off his armour; but the son of Oïleus, enraged on account of
Amphimachus, severed his head from his tender neck, and sent it rolling
like a ball through the crowd; but it fell before the feet of Hector in
the dust.</p>
<p>Then indeed was Neptune grieved at heart for his grandson, slain in the
grievous fight; and he proceeded to go along the tents and ships of the
Greeks, exhorting the Greeks, and prepared disasters for the Trojans.
But spear-renowned Idomeneus then met him, returning from a companion
who had lately come to him from the battle, wounded in the ham with the
sharp brass, whom his comrades had carried in, and he, having given
directions to the surgeons, was returning from his tent; for he still
desired to participate in the fight. Him king Neptune addressed,
assimilating himself, as to his voice, to Thoas, son of Andræmon, who
governed the Ætolians throughout all Pleuron and lofty Calydon, and who
was honoured by the people as a god:</p>
<p>“Idomeneus, thou counsellor of the Cretans, where indeed are the threats
gone, with which the sons of the Greeks threatened the Trojans?” Whom
again in return, Idomeneus, the leader of the Cretans, addressed: “No
man, O Thoas, as far as I know, is at present to blame; for we are all
skilled in warring. Neither does disheartening fear detain any one, nor
does any one, yielding to sloth, shirk evil strife; but thus, doubtless,
it will be agreeable to the all-powerful son of Saturn, that here, far
away from Argos, the Greeks shall perish inglorious. But, Thoas—for
formerly thou wast warlike, and urged on others when thou didst behold
them negligent—so now desist not thyself, but exhort each man.”</p>
<p>But him earth-shaking Neptune then answered: “Never may that man, O
Idomeneus, return from Troy, but let him here be the sport of the dogs,
whosoever voluntarily this day shall relax from fighting. But come,
taking up arms, advance hither; for it behoves us to hasten these
things, if we may be of any service, although but two; for useful is the
valour of men, even the very pusillanimous, if combined, whereas we both
understand how to fight even with the brave.”</p>
<p>So saying, the god departed again to the toil of heroes. But Idomeneus,
when now he had reached his well-made tent, put on his rich armour
around his body, and seized two spears, and hastened to go, like unto
the lightning, which the son of Saturn, seizing in his hand, brandishes
from glittering Olympus, showing a sign to mortals; and brilliant are
its rays: so shone the brass around the breast of him running. Then
Meriones, his good attendant, met him yet near the tent,—for he was
going to fetch a brazen spear; and the strength of Idomeneus addressed
him:</p>
<p>“Meriones, son of Molus, swift of foot, dearest of my companions, why
comest thou thus, quitting the war and the contest? Art thou at all
wounded, and does the point of a spear afflict thee? Or comest thou to
me on any message? For I myself am not desirous to sit within my tent,
but to fight.”</p>
<p>But him prudent Meriones in turn answered: “Idomeneus, thou counsellor
of the brazen-mailed Cretans, I come, if there be any spear left within
thy tents, to take it: because I indeed have broken that which I
formerly had, having struck the shield of ferocious Deïphobus.” Whom
again in turn Idomeneus, leader of the Cretans, addressed: “Thou wilt
find, if thou desirest [to select from them], one-and-twenty spears
standing in my tent against the shining walls, which I have taken from
the slain Trojans; for I affirm that I do not fight with hostile men,
standing at a distance from them. Hence I have both spears, and bossy
shields, and helmets, and corslets, brightly polished.”</p>
<p>But him again prudent Meriones addressed in turn: “At my tent also and
black ship are there many spoils of the Trojans; but they are not near,
so that I might take them. For neither do I conceive that I am forgetful
of valour, but I stand among the foremost in glory-giving battle,
whenever the contest of war has arisen. I am rather unobserved perhaps,
when fighting by some other of the brazen-mailed Greeks; but I think
that thou knowest me.”</p>
<p>Whom again Idomeneus, leader of the Cretans, addressed in turn: “I know
what thou art as to valour: what necessity is there for thee to
enumerate these things? For if now all we the bravest at the ships
should be selected for an ambuscade, where the courage of men is
especially distinguished, where both the coward as well as the brave man
is made apparent—for the complexion of the coward on the one hand is
changed from this to that, nor is his heart calm within his bosom, so
that he can rest without trembling, but he shifts his position, and sits
upon both his feet, whilst his heart greatly palpitates within his
breast, as he is expecting death; and a chattering of his teeth arises.
But neither is the complexion of the brave man changed, nor is he at all
disturbed, after he first sits down in the ambush of heroes; but he
burns to be mingled with all haste in direful fight—[no one], in that
case, would find fault with thy courage and might. For if, labouring [in
the battle], thou wert wounded from a distance, or smitten in close
fight, the weapon would not fall upon thy neck behind, nor upon thy
back; but it would pierce through either thy breast, or thy stomach, as
thou wast rushing forward amid the conflict<span id="footnotetag420"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-13.htm.html#footnote420" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">420</sup></a> of foremost combatants.
But come, no longer let us speak of these things, standing like
infatuated persons, lest perhaps some one chide us inordinately; but do
thou, going to the tent, take a strong spear.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote420"/><b>Footnote 420:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-13.htm.html#footnotetag420" class="pginternal">

<p>Thus be spake, and Meriones, equal to swift Mars, quickly took from the
tent a brazen spear; and he went along with Idomeneus, very eager for
war. But as man-destroying Mars enters the battle—with whom Terror, his
dear son, at the same time powerful and undismayed, follows, who strikes
fear into the warrior even of resolute soul: these indeed are armed from
Thrace, along with the Ephyri or with the magnanimous Phlegyans; neither

<p>But him Idomeneus, the leader of the Cretans, in turn addressed: “Among
the centre ships indeed there are others to aid them, both the Ajaces
and Teucer, who is the most skilful of the Greeks in archery, and brave
also in standing fight; who will sufficiently harass, even to satiety,
Hector, the son of Priam, although most urgent of battle, and although
being very gallant. Hard will it be for him, although very desirous of
fighting, having overpowered their strength and invincible hands, to
fire the ships, unless the son of Saturn himself cast a flaming torch
upon the swift ships. Nor indeed will mighty Telamonian Ajax yield to
any man who may be a mortal, and who may eat the fruit of Ceres, who is
vulnerable by brass and by large stones. Not even to warlike Achilles
would he give way, at least in standing fight; but in speed he is by no
means able to contend with him. Guide us, therefore, to the left of the
army that we may quickly know whether we shall afford glory to any one,
or any one to us.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke. But Meriones, equal to rapid Mars, began to proceed,
until he came to [that part of] the army whither he had ordered him. But
they, when they beheld Idomeneus, like unto a flame in might, both him
and his attendant, in variously-wrought armour, they all, exhorting one
another along the crowd, advanced against him, and an equal contest
arose at the sterns of their ships. And as when storms sweep along,
[driven] by the shrill winds, on a day when the dust around the roads
[is] very abundant, and they at the same time raise up a large cloud of
dust; so came on the battle of these together, and they were eager in
their minds to slaughter one another throughout the throng with the
sharp brass. And the mortal-destroying combat bristles with the long
spears which they held, flesh-rending; and the brazen splendour from the
gleaming helmets, the newly-burnished corslets, and the shining shields,
coming together, dazzled their eyes. Very brave-hearted would he be who,
when beholding their toil, could have rejoiced, and would not be
disturbed.</p>
<p>But the two powerful sons of Saturn, favouring different sides, planned
grievous toils for the heroes. On the one hand, Jove willed victory to
the Trojans and to Hector, glorifying swift-footed Achilles; yet he
desired not entirely to destroy the Grecian people before Ilium, but was
honouring Thetis and her magnanimous son. On the other hand, Neptune,
coming amongst them, encouraged the Greeks, having secretly emerged from
the hoary deep; for he grieved that they should be subdued by the
Trojans, and he was greatly indignant with Jove. The same race indeed
was to both, and the same lineage, but Jove was born first,<span id="footnotetag422"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-13.htm.html#footnote422" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">422</sup></a> and
knew more. For this reason [Neptune] avoided aiding them openly, but
always kept privately inciting them through the army, assimilated to a
man. They indeed alternately stretched over both the cord of vehement
contest and equally destructive war, irrefragable and indissoluble,
which relaxed the knees of many. Then, although half-hoary Idomeneus,
encouraging the Greeks, rushing upon the Trojans, created night; for he
slew Othryoneus, who had come from Cabesus, staying within [Priam’s
house].<span id="footnotetag423"/>

he fought, trusting in these promises. But Idomeneus took aim at him
with his shining spear, and hurling it, struck him, strutting proudly;
nor did the brazen corslet which he wore resist it, but he fixed it in
the middle of his stomach. And falling, he gave a crash, and [the
other] boasted and said:</p>
<p>“Othryoneus! above all men indeed do I praise thee, if thou wilt now in
truth accomplish all which thou hast undertaken for Dardanian Priam: but
he also promised thee his daughter. We likewise, promising these things,
will accomplish them to thee. We will give thee the most beautiful in
form of the daughters of the son of Atreus to wed, bringing her from
Argos, if along with us thou wilt destroy the well-inhabited city of
Ilium. But follow, that we may treat with thee respecting the marriage
of the sea-traversing ships; since we are by no means bad
brothers-in-law.”</p>

he turn back the horses that he might escape from the hands of the
enemy: but him warlike Antilochus, striking, transfixed in the middle

fixed it in the centre of his stomach. Then, panting, he fell from the
well-made chariot-seat, and Antilochus, the son of magnanimous Nestor,
drove away the horses from the Trojans to the well-armed Greeks. But
Deïphobus, enraged on account of Asius, drew very near to Idomeneus, and
hurled with his shining spear. Idomeneus, however, having perceived it
opposite, avoided the brazen spear, for he was concealed behind his
shield equal on all sides, which he bore, constructed of the hides of
bulls, and glittering brass, fitted with two handles. Behind this he
collected himself entirely, and the brazen spear flew over him. But the

<p>Thus he spoke; but grief came upon the Greeks at his boasting, and it
particularly agitated the mind of warlike Antilochus. Yet, grieved as he
was, he neglected not his companion, but running, he protected him, and
covered him over with his shield. Him then his two dear companions,
Mecisteus, son of Echius, and noble Alastor, supporting, bore to the
hollow ships, deeply groaning. In the meantime Idomeneus ceased not his
mighty valour; but always burned either to cover some of the Trojans
with pitchy night,<span id="footnotetag429"/>

destruction from the Greeks. Then the hero Alcathous, the beloved son of
Æsyetas (and he was the son-in-law of Anchises, for he had married
Hippodamia, the eldest of his daughters, whom her father and venerable
mother loved from their hearts, whilst in their home, because she
excelled all of her age in beauty, in accomplishments, and prudence,
for which reason also the most distinguished man in wide Troy had wedded
her), him Neptune subdued under Idomeneus, having dimmed his shining
eyes, and fettered his fair limbs. For he was able neither to fly back
nor to turn aside, but him, standing motionless, like a pillar or
lofty-branching tree, the hero Idomeneus wounded with his spear in the
middle of the breast, and burst the brazen coat around him, which
formerly warded off destruction from his body: but then it sent forth a
dry sound, severed by the spear. Falling, he gave a crash, and the spear
was fixed in his heart, which, palpitating, shook even the extremity of
the spear; and there at length the impetuous Mars<span id="footnotetag430"/>

But Idomeneus boasted prodigiously over him, loudly exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Deïphobus! do we judge rightly that it is a fair return, that three
should be slain for one, since thus thou boastest? But do thou thyself
also, wretch, stand against me, that thou mayest know of what nature I
am, who have come hither the offspring of Jove, who first begat Minos,
the guardian of Crete. Minos again begat Deucalion, his blameless son,
and Deucalion begat me, king over many men in wide Crete. But now the
ships have brought me hither, an evil both to thee and to thy father,
and the other Trojans.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, but Deïphobus hesitated between two opinions, whether,
falling back, he should join to himself some one of the magnanimous
Trojans, or make trial although alone. But to him, thus deliberating, it
appeared preferable to go in search of Æneas; whom he found standing at
the rear of the army, for he was ever indignant with noble Priam,
because he by no means honoured him, though being valiant among heroes.
And, standing near, he addressed to him winged words:</p>
<p>“Æneas, thou counsellor of the Trojans, now does it greatly behove thee
to aid thy brother-in-law, if indeed any regard reaches thee. But
follow, let us bring aid to Alcathous, who, being thy brother-in-law,
nourished thee whilst very young, in his palace, and whom spear-famed
Idomeneus hath slain.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, and roused the courage in his breast, and he, greatly
desirous of battle, went to meet Idomeneus. Yet fear seized not
Idomeneus like a tender boy, but he stood still, like a boar in the
mountains, confident in his prowess, and who abides the mighty din of
men advancing against him, in a desert place,<span id="footnotetag431"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-13.htm.html#footnote431" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">431</sup></a> and bristles up his
back; his eyes, too, gleam with fire, and he whets his teeth, eager to
keep at bay both dogs and men. So spear-renowned Idomeneus awaited
Æneas, swift in the battle-din, coming against him, nor retired; but he
shouted to his companions, looking to Ascalaphus, and Aphareus, and
Deïpyrus, and Meriones, and Antilochus, skilful in fight. Exhorting
these, he addressed to them winged words:</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote431"/><b>Footnote 431:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-13.htm.html#footnotetag431" class="pginternal">
(return) </a> Or, “in the sheep-pasture.”</p>
<p>“Hither, my friends, and aid me alone, for I greatly dread swift-footed
Æneas, rushing on, who is coming upon me; who is very powerful to slay
men in battle, and possesses the bloom of youth, which is the greatest
strength. For if we were of the same age, with the spirit that I now
possess, quickly would either he bear off great glory, or I would.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but they all, having one determination in their minds,
stood near him, inclining their shields upon their shoulders. Æneas, on
the other hand, animated his companions, looking towards Deïphobus,
Paris, and noble Agenor, who, together with himself, were leaders of the
Trojans. These also the people followed, as sheep follow from their
pasture after the ram in order to drink; and the shepherd then is
rejoiced in his mind. So was the soul of Æneas gladdened in his breast,
when he beheld a body of troops following himself. These therefore
engaged in close fight round Alcathous with long spears, whilst the
brass resounded horribly on the breasts of them, aiming at each other
through the crowd. But two warlike men, conspicuous among the rest,
Æneas and Idomeneus, equal to Mars, longed to lacerate each other’s
flesh with the ruthless brass. But Æneas first hurled his javelin at
Idomeneus; but he, perceiving it opposite, avoided the brazen spear; and
the spear of Æneas sank quivering into the earth; for it fled in vain
from his sturdy hand. Idomeneus next smote Œnomaus in the middle of the
stomach, and the spear burst the cavity of his corslet, and penetrating,
drank his entrails through; but falling amid the dust, he grasped the
earth with the hollow of his hand. Then Idomeneus plucked out the long
spear from his body, but was unable to tear off the other rich armour
from his shoulders, for he was pressed hard by weapons. For no longer
were the sinews of his feet firm as he rushed, either to hasten on after
his own dart,<span id="footnotetag432"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-13.htm.html#footnote432" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">432</sup></a> or avoid [that of another]. Wherefore also in
standing fight, he warded off the fatal day, nor did his feet any longer
bear him with ease in retreating from the battle. But against him,
gradually retiring, Deïphobus took aim with his glittering spear, for he
ever had a rooted hatred towards him. But then too he missed, and struck
with his javelin Ascalaphus, the son of Mars, and drove the stout spear
through his shoulder; and tailing amid the dust, he grasped the earth
with his hand.</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote432"/><b>Footnote 432:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-13.htm.html#footnotetag432" class="pginternal">

son had fallen in the violent fight; but he sat upon the summit of
Olympus, beneath golden clouds, excluded [from the battle] by the will
of Jove, where also the other immortal gods were restrained from the
war. In the meantime they engaged in close fight round Ascalaphus.
Deïphobus indeed tore the shining helmet from Ascalaphus; and Meriones,
equal to swift Mars, springing [upon him], smote [him] with his spear in
the arm, and the crested<span id="footnotetag434"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-13.htm.html#footnote434" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">434</sup></a> casque, falling from his hand, rang upon
the earth. Immediately Meriones, leaping upon him like a vulture,
plucked out the tough spear from the lower part of his arm, and retired
back again into the crowd of his comrades. But him Polites, his own
brother, throwing his hands round his waist, carried out of the
dread-sounding battle, till he reached his fleet steeds, which awaited
him in the rear of the combat and the war, having both a charioteer and
a variegated car; which then carried him towards the city, groaning
heavily [and] afflicted; and the blood flowed from his recently-wounded
hand: but the others kept fighting, and an unquenchable clamour arose.
Then Æneas rushing upon Aphareus, the son of Caletor, smote him with his
sharp spear upon the throat, when turned towards him. And his head was
bent to one side, then his shield clung to him, and his helmet; and
around him life-destroying death was spread. Antilochus, however,
observing Thoas turning around, attacking, wounded him; and cut away all
the vein, which, running quite along the back, reaches to the neck. All
this he cut off; but he fell on his back in the dust, stretching out
both hands to his beloved companions. Then Antilochus sprang upon him,
and stripped the armour from his shoulders, looking around; for the
Trojans surrounding him, struck his wide and ornamented shield with
their darts, nor were they able to graze with the dire brass the tender
body of Antilochus within it; because earth-shaking Neptune protected
the son of Nestor all round, even amongst many weapons. For never indeed
was he apart from the enemy, but he turned himself about among them: nor
did he hold his spear without motion, but continually moving, it was
whirled about; and he prepared within his mind, either to hurl it at
some one afar off, or to rush upon some one close at hand. But
meditating these things amid the throng, he escaped not the notice of
Adamas, the son of Asias, who smote him in the middle of his shield with
the sharp brass, attacking him in close combat; but azure-haired Neptune
weakened the spear, grudging<span id="footnotetag435"/>

of Antilochus, and the other half lay upon the ground; whilst he gave
backwards into the crowd of his companions, shunning death. Meriones,
however, following him departing, smote him with his spear between the
private parts and the navel, where a wound<span id="footnotetag437"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-13.htm.html#footnote437" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">437</sup></a> is particularly painful
to miserable mortals. There he fixed the spear in him; and he falling,
struggled panting around the spear, as an ox, when cowherds in the
mountains, forcibly binding him with twisted cords, lead [him] away
unwilling. So he, wounded, throbbed, though but for a short time, and
not very long, until the hero Meriones coming near, plucked the spear
from his body; and darkness veiled his eyes. But Helenas, close at hand,
struck Deïpyrus upon the temple with his huge Thracian sword, and cut
away the three-coned helmet; which, being dashed off, fell upon the
ground; and some one of the combating Greeks lifted it up, having rolled
between his feet; whilst dim night enveloped his eyes. Then grief seized
the son of Atreus, Menelaus, brave in the din of battle, and he
advanced, threatening the hero, king Helenus; brandishing his sharp
spear, whilst the other drew the horn of his bow. Together then they
darted, the one eager to launch his fir-tree spear, and the other an
arrow from the string. Then indeed the son of Priam smote him in the
breast with an arrow, on the cavity of the corslet, but the bitter shaft
rebounded. As when from the broad winnowing-fan in a large
threshing-floor, the black-coated beans or vetches leap at the shrill
blast, and the force of the winnower; so, strongly repulsed by the
corslet of glorious Menelaus, the bitter arrow flew afar. But Menelaus,
the son of Atreus, brave in the din of battle, smote him upon the hand
which held his well-polished bow; and in the bow the brazen spear was
fixed from the opposite side, through his hand. Then he retired back
into the crowd of his companions, avoiding death, hanging down his hand
at his side, but the ashen spear was trailed along with him. And then
magnanimous Agenor extracted it from his hand, and bound [the hand]
itself sling-ways in well-twisted sheep’s wool, which his attendant
carried for the shepherd of the people.</p>

<p>But Pisander went direct against glorious Menelaus, because evil Fate
led him towards the end of death, to be subdued by thee, O Menelaus, in
the dire battle. When therefore they were near, advancing against each
other, the son of Atreus indeed missed, and his spear was turned aside
from him; but Pisander smote the shield of glorious Menelaus, nor could
he drive the spear quite through; because the broad shield kept it off,
and the spear was broken at the extremity: still he rejoiced in his
mind, and hoped for victory. The son of Atreus, however, drawing his
silver-studded sword, sprang upon Pisander; but he drew from beneath his
shield a handsome battle-axe of well-wrought brass, fixed upon either

injured me, vile dogs, nor have ye at all dreaded in your minds the
heavy wrath of high-thundering, hospitable Jove, who will yet destroy
for you your lofty city; ye who unprovoked departed, carrying off my
virgin spouse, and much wealth, after ye had been hospitably received by
her. Now again do ye eagerly desire to hurl destructive fire upon the
sea-traversing ships, and to slay the Grecian heroes. But ye shall yet
be restrained, impetuous as ye be, from war. O father Jove, assuredly
they say that thou excellest all others, men and gods, in prudence, yet
from thee do all these things proceed. How much dost thou gratify these
insolent Trojan men, whose violence is ever pernicious, and who cannot
be satisfied with war, equally destructive to all! Of all things is
there satiety,—of sleep, of love, of sweet singing, and of faultless
dancing, with which one would much more readily satisfy his desire, than
with war; but the Trojans are insatiate of battle.”</p>

<p>So saying, having stripped the bloody armour from the body, illustrious
Menelaus gave it to his companions, whilst he, advancing, was again
mixed with the foremost combatants. Then Harpalion, the son of king
Pylæmenes, who had then followed his dear father to wage war at Troy,
leaped upon him; nor returned he back to his native land. [He it was]
who then, close at hand, struck the middle of Atrides’ shield with his
lance, nor was he able to drive quite through the brass; but he retired
back into the crowd of his companions, avoiding death, looking around on
all sides, lest any one should touch his body<span id="footnotetag439"/>

Meriones, however, shot a brazen-pointed arrow at him retreating, and
struck him upon the right hip, and the arrow penetrated to the other
side, through the bladder, below the bone. Sinking down, therefore, in
the same place, breathing out his life in the arms of his beloved
companions, like a worm, he lay stretched upon the ground, whilst his
black blood flowed, and moistened the earth. Around him the magnanimous
Paphlagonians were employed, and, lifting him upon a chariot, they bore
him to sacred Ilium, grieving; and with them went his father, shedding
tears: but no vengeance was taken for his dead son.</p>

<p>But Paris was greatly enraged in his soul on account of his being slain,
for he had been his guest among many Paphlagonians; wherefore, enraged
on his account, he sent forth a brazen arrow. Now there was one
Euchenor, son of the diviner Polyïdus, wealthy and brave, inhabiting a
dwelling at Corinth, who, well knowing his fatal destiny, had arrived in
a ship. For often had Polyïdus, good old man, told him, that he would
perish in his halls of a grievous disease, or be subdued by the Trojans
among the ships of the Greeks; wherefore he avoided at once the severe
mulct<span id="footnotetag440"/>

sorrows in his mind. Him he (Paris) smote below the jaw and the ear; and

<p>Thus indeed they fought like<span id="footnotetag441"/>

to Jove, had not learned, nor knew at all, how at the left of the ships
his people were being slaughtered by the Greeks, for the victory was on
the point of being the Grecians’; so much did earth-shaking Neptune
encourage the Greeks, and moreover himself assisted with his strength;
but he (Hector) pressed on where first he had sprung within the gates
and wall, breaking the thick ranks of the shielded Greeks. There were
the ships of Ajax and Protesilaus, drawn up upon the shore of the hoary
sea; but above<span id="footnotetag442"/>

Bœotians and long-robed Iaonians, the Locrians, the Phthians, and the
illustrious Epeans, restrained him from the ships, fiercely rushing on;
but were unable to drive away from them noble Hector, like unto a flame.
The chosen men of the Athenians stood in the van; among whom
Menestheus, son of Peteus, had the command; and with him followed
Phidas, Stichius, and brave Bias, Meges, the son of Phyieus, Amphion,
and Dracius, led the Epeans, and over the Phthians were Medon and
Podarces, steady in fight (Medon indeed was the spurious offspring of

<p>But Ajax, the swift son of Oïleus, never separated from Telamonian Ajax,
not even for a little time; but as in a fallow field two black bullocks
possessing equal spirit, draw a well-joined plough,—but meanwhile
copious sweat breaks forth around the roots of their horns; and them the
well-polished yoke alone separates on either side, advancing along the
furrows, and [the plough] cuts<span id="footnotetag445"/>

twain, joined together, stood very near to each other. And then many and
brave troops followed the son of Telamon as companions, who received
from him his shield, whenever fatigue and sweat came upon his limbs. But
the Locrians followed not the great-souled son of Oïleus, for their
heart remained not firm to them in the standing fight, because they had
not brazen helmets crested with horse-hair, nor had they well-orbed
shields and ashen spears; but they followed along with him to Ilium,
trusting in the bows and the well-twisted sheep’s wool, with which,
frequently hurling, they broke the phalanxes of the Trojans. At that
time indeed these (the Ajaces) in the van, with their variously-wrought
armour, fought against the Trojans and brazen-armed Hector, whilst (the
Locrians) shooting from the rear, lay concealed; nor were the Trojans
any longer mindful of combat, for the arrows put them in confusion.</p>
<p>Then surely would the Trojans have retreated with loss from the ships
and tents to lofty Ilium, had not Polydamas, standing near, addressed
bold Hector:</p>
<p>“Hector, thou art impossible to be persuaded by advice.<span id="footnotetag446"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-13.htm.html#footnote446" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">446</sup></a> Because

one indeed hath the deity given warlike deeds; to another dancing; and
to another the harp and singing. To another again far-sounding Jove
implants a prudent mind in his bosom, of which many men reap the
advantage, as it (prudence) even preserves cities; and he himself (who
possesses it) especially knows (its value). Yet will I speak as appears
to me best; because the encircling host<span id="footnotetag448"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-13.htm.html#footnote448" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">448</sup></a> of war burns round thee on
all sides, and the magnanimous Trojans, since they have crossed the
walls, some indeed stand apart with their arms, and others fight, the
fewer against the greater number, scattered amongst the ships. But
retiring back, summon hither all the chiefs. And then we can better
discuss the whole plan; whether we shall enter upon the many-benched
ships, if indeed the deity will give us victory; or depart uninjured
from the barks; because of a truth I fear lest the Greeks repay their
debt of yesterday, since a man, insatiate in war, still remains at the
ships, who I conceive will no longer abstain entirely from battle.” Thus
spoke Polydamas, but the faultless advice pleased Hector; and
immediately he leaped with his armour from his chariot to the ground,
and, addressing him, spoke winged words:</p>

<p>“Polydamas, do thou retain here all the bravest, whilst I will come back
again immediately after I have given proper orders to the [troops].” He
said, and shouting, he rushed on, like unto a snowy mountain, and flew
through the Trojans and the allies. But they all crowded round
valour-loving Polydamas, the son of Panthous, as soon as they heard the
voice of Hector. He, however, ranged through the foremost combatants,
seeking if he could anywhere find Deïphobus, the might of king Helenus,
and Adamas, the son of Asias, and Asius, the son of Hyrtacus. Some he
found no longer quite unhurt, nor yet destroyed, whilst others again lay
at the sterns of the ships of the Greeks, having lost their lives by the
hands of the Greeks; and others were stricken or wounded within the
wall. But he quickly found noble Alexander, the husband of fair-haired
Helen, on the left of the lamentable battle, cheering of his companions,
and encouraging them to fight; and, standing near, he addressed him with
reproachful words:</p>
<p>“Accursed Paris, fine only in person, woman-mad, seducer, where are
Deïphobus and the might of king Helenus, and Adamas, the son of Asias,
and Asius, the son of Hyrtacus? Where also is Othryoneus? Now lofty

certain.”</p>

(return) </a> The Latin “a culmine,” as in Virg. Æn. ii. 290,
   603. So Æsch.</p>
<p>But him godlike Alexander in turn addressed: “Hector, since it is thy
intention to find fault with me when innocent, at some other time
perhaps, I may be more neglectful of the fight; [but not now], since
neither did my mother bear me altogether unwarlike. For from the time
when thou didst stir up the battle of thy companions at the ships, from
that time, remaining here, have we engaged incessantly with the Greeks;
and those comrades are dead for whom thou inquirest. Deïphobus and the
might of king Helenus alone have withdrawn, both wounded in the hand
with long spears; but the son of Saturn hath warded off death [from
them]. But now lead on, wheresoever thy heart and soul urge thee; and we
will follow with determined minds, nor do I think that thou wilt be at
all in want of valour, as much strength as is in us. It is not possible
even for one, although keenly desirous, to fight beyond his strength.”</p>
<p>So saying, the hero persuaded the mind of his brother, and they hastened
to advance towards that place where especially was the battle and
contest; round Cebriones and excellent Polydamas, Phalces and Orthæus,
and godlike Polyphœtes, and Palmys, and Ascanius and Morys, the sons of
Hippotion, who the day before had come as a relief guard<span id="footnotetag450"/>

<p>So the Trojans, first indeed some in battle array, and then others
glittering in brass, followed along with their leaders. But Hector, the
son of Priam, equal to man-slaughtering Mars, led the van, and held
before him his shield, equal on all sides, thick with skins; and much
brass was laid over it: and round his temples his gleaming helmet was
shaken. Stepping forward, he tried the phalanxes around on every side,
if perchance they would give way to him, advancing under cover of his
shield. Yet he disturbed not the courage of the Greeks in their breasts:
but Ajax, far-striding, first challenged him:</p>
<p>“O noble Sir, draw nearer: why dost thou thus frighten the Greeks? We
Greeks are by no means unskilful in battle, although we are subdued by
the evil scourge<span id="footnotetag452"/>

plunder the ships; but we also have hands ready to repulse thee
immediately. Assuredly, long before shall thy well-inhabited city be
taken and destroyed by our hands. But to thee thyself, I say, the time
draws near, when, flying, thou shalt pray to father Jove and the other
immortals, that thy fair-maned steeds, which shall bear thee to the
city, raising dust over the plain, may become swifter than hawks.”</p>

<p>Whilst he was thus speaking, a bird flew over him on the right—a
lofty-flying eagle; upon which the people of the Greeks shouted,
encouraged by the omen; but illustrious Hector replied:</p>
<p>“O babbling and vain-boasting Ajax, what hast thou said? Would that I
were as sure of becoming for ever the child of ægis-bearing Jove, that
the venerable Juno had borne me, and that I were honoured as Minerva and
Apollo are honoured, as that this day now certainly brings destruction
upon all the Greeks; and among others thou shalt be slain, if thou wilt
dare to abide my long spear, which shall tear for thee thy dainty
person, and thou shalt satiate the dogs and birds of the Trojans with
thy fat and flesh, falling at the ships of the Greeks.”</p>
<p>Thus then having spoken, he led on; and they followed along with him
with a mighty shout, and the troops likewise shouted in the rear. The
Greeks, on the other side, raised a shout, nor were they forgetful of
their valour, but they awaited the bravest of the Trojans, assaulting.
But the clamour of both reached to the æther and the shining
splendour<span id="footnotetag453"/>
