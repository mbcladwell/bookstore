<h2>BOOK THE FOURTEENTH.</h2>
<h4 id="pgepubid00034">ARGUMENT.</h4>
<p>Agamemnon and the other wounded chiefs visit the battle with Nestor.
Juno, having borrowed the cestus of Venus, first obtains the assistance
of Sleep, and then hastens to Ida to inveigle Jove. She prevails, Jove
sleeps, and Neptune seizes the opportunity to aid the Trojans.</p>
<p class="p2">
But the shouting did not entirely escape the notice of Nestor, although
drinking, but he addressed winged words to the son of Æsculapius:
“Consider, noble Machaon, how these things will be; greater, certainly,
[grows] the shouting of the blooming youths at the ships. But sitting
here at present, drink indeed the dark wine, until fair-haired Hecamede
has warmed the tepid baths, and washed away the bloody gore; whilst I,
going with speed to a watchtower, will gain information.”</p>
<p>So saying, he took the well-made shield of his own son, horse-breaking
Thrasymedes, [which was] lying in the tent, all shining with brass (for
he had the shield of his sire); and seized a strong spear, pointed with
sharp brass; and stood without the tent, and soon beheld an unseemly
deed,—these [the Greeks] in confusion, and those, the haughty Trojans,
routing them in the rear; but the wall of the Greeks had fallen. And as
when the vast deep blackens with the noiseless<span id="footnotetag454"/>

with no effect, the rapid courses of the shrill blasts, nor yet is it
rolled forwards or backwards, before some decisive blast comes down from
Jove: so meditated the old man, distracted in his mind between two
opinions: whether he should go amongst the throng of fleet-horsed
Greeks, or to Agamemnon, the son of Atreus, shepherd of the people. But
to him thus reflecting, it appeared better to go in quest of the son of
Atreus. Meanwhile they kept slaughtering each other, contending, and the
solid brass around their bodies rang, as they were stricken with the
swords and two-edged spears.</p>

(return) </a> Literally, “deaf.” So “surdi fluctus,” Ovid,
   Epist. xviii. 211; “Omnia surda tacent,” Propert. iv. 3, 53;
   “Surdaque vota condidit Ionio,” Pers. Sat. vi. 28.</p>
<p>But the Jove-cherished kings, coming up from the vessels, met Nestor, as
many as had been wounded with the brass,—Tydides, and Ulysses, and
Agamemnon, the son of Atreus. Their ships indeed were drawn up upon the
shore of the hoary deep, very far away from the battle; for they had
drawn the first as far as the plain, and had built a wall at their
sterns. For, broad as it was, the shore was by no means able to contain
their vessels, and the people were crowded. Wherefore they drew them up
in rows one behind the other, and filled the wide mouth of the whole
shore, as much as the promontories enclosed. There then were they
walking together, leaning upon the spear, in order to behold the tumult
and the battle; and the heart in their bosoms was grieved. But aged
Nestor met them, and terrified the souls in the breasts of the Greeks:
whom first king Agamemnon addressing, said:</p>
<p>“O Neleïan Nestor, great glory of the Greeks, why, leaving the
man-destroying battle, comest thou hither? Truly I fear lest impetuous
Hector make good his speech, as once he threatened, haranguing among the
Trojans, that he would not return to Ilium from the ships, before that
he had burned the ships with fire, and slain us also: thus indeed he
harangued; and now are all things fulfilling. Ye gods, surely the other
well-greaved Greeks, as well as Achilles, store up wrath against me in
their minds; nor are they willing to fight at the sterns of the ships.”</p>
<p>But him the Gerenian knight Nestor then answered: “Assuredly these
things are in active accomplishment, nor could even lofty-thundering
Jove himself contrive them otherwise; for the wall, in which we trusted
that it would be an impregnable defence to the ships and to ourselves,
has now fallen. But they are sustaining an obstinate contest at the
swift ships; nor couldst thou any longer distinguish, though examining
particularly, on which side the Greeks, confounded, are routed; so
promiscuously are they slain, whilst the shout reaches heaven. Let us,
however, deliberate how these things will be, if counsel avail anything;
although I advise not that we enter the battle; for it is by no means
proper that a wounded man should fight.”</p>
<p>But him then answered Agamemnon, king of men. “Nestor, since they are
combating at the sterns of the ships, and the constructed rampart avails
not, nor the ditch, at which the Greeks suffered much, and hoped in
their minds that it would be an impregnable defence to the ships and to
themselves, surely it will be agreeable to all-powerful Jove that the
Greeks perish here, inglorious, far away from Argos. For I was conscious
when he willingly gave assistance to the Greeks, and I now know that he
honours those [the Trojans] equally with the happy gods, but hath
fettered our courage and our hands. But come, let us all obey as I shall
advise. Let us draw down the ships, as many as are drawn up first near
the sea, and launch them all into the vast ocean. Let us moor them at
anchor in the deep, till mortal-deceiving<span id="footnotetag455"/>

then the Trojans may abstain from battle, and then we may perhaps draw
down all the vessels; for there is no disgrace in flying from evil, not
even during the night. It is better for a flying man to escape from
evil, than to be taken.”</p>

<p>But him sternly regarding, wise Ulysses then addressed: “Son of Atreus,
what speech hath escaped thy lips? Lost man! thou shouldst command some
worthless army, and not rule over us, to whom Jove hath granted, from
youth even unto old age, to accomplish toilsome wars, until we, each of
us, shall perish. Dost thou then desire thus to leave wide-wayed Troy,
on account of which we have endured so many woes? Be silent, lest some
other of the Greeks hear a speech, which a man ought not to have brought
through his mouth, whoever understands in his mind how to speak prudent
things, who is a sceptre-bearer, and whom so many people obey, as many
as thou dost govern among the Greeks. For now do I reprobate thy
judgment, in what thou hast said; who commandest us, whilst the war and
battle are waged, to draw down the well-benched ships to the sea, in
order that the wishes of the Trojans may be still better fulfilled,
victorious though they be, and dire destruction fall upon us: for the
Greeks will not maintain the fight whilst the ships are being dragged to
the sea, but will look back, and retire from the combat. Then will thy
counsel be injurious, O leader of the people.”</p>
<p>But him Agamemnon, the king of men, then answered: “Much, O Ulysses,
hast thou touched me to the soul with thy severe reproof; yet I
commanded not the sons of the Greeks against their will to draw the
well-benched ships down to the sea. But now would that there were one,
either young or old, who would deliver an opinion better than this; it
would be to my joy.” <span id="footnotetag456"/>

<p>But among them Diomede, valiant in the din of battle, also spoke: “The
man is near, we need not seek far, if indeed ye are willing to be
persuaded; and do not find fault each through wrath, because I am by
birth the youngest amongst you; for I boast that my race is from a noble
sire, Tydeus, whom the heaped-up earth<span id="footnotetag457"/>

Portheus were born three distinguished sons, and they dwelt in Pleuron
and lofty Calydon: Agrius and Melas, but the third was the knight Œneus,
the father of my father, who was conspicuous among them for valour. He
indeed remained there, but my father, as an exile, dwelt at Argos, for
so Jove willed and the other gods. But he married [one] of the

surpassed the Greeks in the use of the spear; but these things ye ought
to know, since it is a truth. Do not, therefore, dispute the opinion
freely delivered, which I give advisedly, deeming that I am base by
birth, and unwarlike. Come, then, let us go to battle, wounded as we
are, from necessity. There, then, let us ourselves approach the combat,
out [of the reach] of weapons, lest any one receive wound upon wound;
and, encouraging others, we will urge them on, who hitherto, gratifying
their souls, have stood apart, nor fought.”</p>

<p>Thus he spoke; and to him they all listened readily, and obeyed.
Wherefore they hastened to advance, and the king of men, Agamemnon, led
them.</p>
<p>Nor did the illustrious Earth-shaker keep a negligent look-out, but he
went amongst them like unto an aged man, and he caught the right hand of
Agamemnon, the son of Atreus, and addressing him, spoke winged words:</p>
<p>“Son of Atreus, now perchance the revengeful heart of Achilles rejoices
in his breast, beholding the slaughter and rout of the Greeks; since
there is no feeling in him, not even a little. May he, however, thus
perish, and may a god cover him with disgrace. But with thee the blessed
gods are not yet altogether enraged, but again the leaders and chiefs of
the Trojans will perchance raise the dust upon the wide plain, and thou
wilt behold them flying towards the city from the ships and the tents.”</p>
<p>So saying, he shouted aloud, rushing over the plain. As loud as nine or
ten thousand men shout, beginning the contest of Mars, so loud a cry did
king Neptune send forth from his breast; and he cast great resolution
into every heart among the Greeks, to war and to fight incessantly.</p>
<p>But golden-throned Juno, standing, looked down with her eyes from the
summit of Olympus, and immediately recognized her own brother, [who
was] also her brother-in-law, exerting himself through the glorious
battle, and she rejoiced in her mind. She also beheld Jove sitting upon
the highest top of many-rilled Ida, and he was hateful to her soul. Then
the venerable large-eyed Juno next anxiously considered how she could
beguile the mind of ægis-bearing Jove. And now this plan appeared best
to her mind, to proceed to Ida, having well arrayed herself, if
perchance he might desire to lie beside her form<span id="footnotetag460"/>

heaven. With this having anointed her body, and having also combed her

shone from [her]. From above she, divine of goddesses, covered herself
with a veil, beautiful, newly wrought, and it was bright as the sun; and

straight from her chamber; and having called Venus apart from the other
gods, addressed her in speech:</p>

<p>But her sweet Sleep answering, addressed: “Juno, venerable goddess,
daughter of great Saturn, any other of the everlasting gods could I
easily lull to sleep, and even the flowing of rapid Ocean, who is the
parent of all; but I could not approach Saturnian Jove, nor lull him to
sleep, unless, at least, he himself command me. For once already, at
least, has he terrified me by his threats, on that day when the
magnanimous son of Jove (Hercules) sailed from Ilium, having sacked the
city of the Trojans. Then I lulled the mind of ægis-bearing Jove, being
poured gently around him, whilst thou wast planning evils in thy mind
[against the hero], rousing the blasts of bitter winds over the deep;
and thou didst afterwards carry him away apart from all his friends to
well-inhabited Cos. But he, when awakened, was enraged, hurling about
the gods through his mansion, and me chiefly of all he sought, and would
have cast me down, a lost one, from the æther into the deep, had not
Night, vanquisher of gods and men, preserved me, to whom I came flying.

<p>But him the venerable large-eyed Juno in turn answered: “Ο Sleep, why

far-sounding Jove favours the Trojans, as he was enraged on account of
Hercules, his own son? But come, [do this], and I will give thee one of

they both advanced over the land, and the summit of the wood was shaken
beneath their feet. There Sleep on his part remained, before the eyes of
Jove should perceive him; ascending a lofty fir, which then growing the
highest upon Ida, sprung up through the air to the clouds. There he sat,
thickly covered with the fir branches, like unto a shrill bird, which,
living in the mountains, the gods call Chalcis, and men Cymindis.</p>

in love upon the summit of Ida, where all places are exposed, how will
it be, if any of the immortal gods should perceive us sleeping, and,

for thee, and fitted its secure doors to its lintels. Thither let us
repair, about to recline, since an embrace is indeed thy desire.”</p>

<p>Thus quietly slumbered the sire upon the summit of Gargarus, subdued by
sleep and love, and held his spouse in his arms. But sweet Sleep
hastened to run to the ships of the Greeks, that he might deliver a
message to Neptune, the shaker of the earth. And, standing near, he
addressed to him winged words:</p>
<p>“Now, Neptune, heartily give aid to the Greeks, and bestow glory upon
them, at least for a little, whilst yet Jove sleeps; since I have
enveloped him in a veil<span id="footnotetag480"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-14.htm.html#footnote480" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">480</sup></a> of soft slumber, and Juno hath deceived

(return) </a> Observe the force of περικάλυψα.</p>
<p>So saying, he indeed departed to the illustrious tribes of men; but he
still more impelled [Neptune] to assist the Greeks, and immediately
springing forward far into the van, he exhorted them:</p>
<p>“O Greeks, yet again do we yield the victory to Hector, the son of
Priam, that he may seize the ships and bear away glory? For so indeed he
supposes and boasts, because Achilles remains at the hollow ships,
enraged at heart. However, there would not be a great need of him, if
the rest of us were incited to assist one another. But come? let us all
obey as I shall advise. Let us, clad with shields, as many as are best
and greatest in the army, who are covered as to our heads with
glittering helmets, and hold the longest spears in our hands, advance,
and I will lead the way; nor do I think that Hector, the son of Priam,
will await us, though very eager. Whatsoever man also is obstinate in
the fight, and bears but a small shield upon his shoulder, let him give
it to an inferior man, and let him clothe himself in a larger shield.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but they listened to him readily, and obeyed. The kings
themselves, Tydides, Ulysses, and Agamemnon, son of Atreus, marshalled
[the troops], wounded as they were; and, going about among them all,
exchanged their martial arms, the brave [soldier] put on the good
[armour], and the worse they gave to the inferior man. But when they had
girded the splendid brass around their bodies, they began to advance;
and earth-shaking Neptune led them on, grasping in his firm hand a
dreadful tapering sword, like unto a thunderbolt, with which [sword] it
is not possible to engage in destructive battle, for the fear [of it]
restrains men.</p>
<p>On the other side again illustrious Hector drew up the Trojans. Then
truly azure-haired Neptune and illustrious Hector drew forth the
severest struggle of war, the one indeed aiding the Trojans, and the
other the Greeks. But the sea was dashed up to the tents and ships of
the Greeks and they engaged with a mighty shout. Not so loudly does the
billow of the ocean roar against the main land, when driven from the
deep by the rough blast of Boreas; nor so great is the crackling of
blazing fire in the glens of a mountain, when it is raised aloft to
consume the wood; nor so loud howls the wind amidst the high-foliaged
oaks (which, in particular, loudly roars in its wrath), as was the cry
of the Trojans and Greeks shouting dreadfully, when they rushed one upon
the other.</p>
<p>At Ajax illustrious Hector first took aim with his spear, as he was
turned right against him; nor did he miss. [He struck him] where the two
belts were crossed upon his breast, both that of the shield and that of
the silver-studded sword; for these protected the tender skin: but
Hector was enraged because his swift weapon had fled from his hand in
vain, and he retired back into the crowd of his companions, shunning
death. At him then, retiring, mighty Telamonian Ajax [threw] with a
stone, for [stones] in great numbers were rolled about among the feet of
the combatants, props for the fleet barks; lifting up one of these, he
struck him upon the breast, above the orb of the shield, near the neck.
And, throwing, he twirled it like a top, and it (the stone) rolled round
on all sides. As when, beneath a violent stroke from father Jove, an oak
falls uprooted, and a terrible smell of sulphur arises from it; but
confidence no longer possesses the man, whosoever being near beholds it,
because the thunderbolt of mighty Jove is terrible: so rapidly upon the
ground fell the might of Hector in the dust. And he dropped his spear
from his hand, his shield and helmet followed above him, and his armour,
variegated with brass, rang upon him. Then the sons of the Greeks,
loudly shouting, rushed in, hoping to draw him off, and they hurled
numerous javelins; but no one was able either to strike from a distance,
or to smite close at hand, the shepherd of the people, for the bravest
[of the warriors], Polydamas, Æneas, and noble Agenor, Sarpedon, leader
of the Lycians, and illustrious Glaucus, first threw themselves round
him. And no one of the rest neglected him, but they held their
well-orbed shields before him. But his companions, up-raising him in
their hands, bore him out of the conflict, till they reached his fleet
horses, which stood for him in rear of the combat and the war, holding
both the charioteer and the variegated car; which then carried him
towards the city, groaning heavily.<span id="footnotetag481"/>

<p>But when now they came to the ford of the rapid-flowing current of
eddying Xanthus, whom immortal Jove begat, there they removed him from
his car to the ground, and poured water over him; but he breathed again,
and looked up with his eyes; and, sitting upon his knees, disgorged
black blood. Again he fell back upon the ground, and dark night
overshadowed his eyes; for the blow still subdued his spirits.</p>
<p>But when the Greeks saw Hector going apart, they pressed the more on the
Trojans, and were mindful of contest. Then swift Oïlean Ajax before
others, leaping forward with his fir-tree spear, wounded Satnius, son of
Enops, whom a Naiad, the fairest nymph, bore to Enops, when keeping his
flocks by the banks of Satnio. Him the spear-renowned son of Oïleus,
drawing near, wounded in the flank; but he fell supine, and round him
the Trojans and Greeks engaged in a valiant battle. But to him
spear-brandishing Polydamas, son of Panthous, came as an avenger, and
smote Prothoënor, son of Areïlochus, upon the right shoulder. The tough
spear passed on through his shoulder, but falling in the dust, he
grasped the earth with his hand. And Polydamas boasted mightily over
him, shouting aloud:</p>
<p>“I do not think, indeed, that the weapon hath fled vainly from the
sturdy hand of the magnanimous son of Panthous, but some one of the
Greeks has received it in his body; and I think that he, leaning upon
it, will descend to the mansion of Pluto.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, but grief arose among the Greeks at his boasting, and
particularly agitated the mind of warlike Ajax, the son of Telamon, for
he had fallen very near him; and he immediately hurled with his shining
spear at him departing. Polydamas himself indeed avoided black fate,
springing off obliquely; but Archilochus, son of Antenor, received [the
blow], for to him the gods had doomed destruction. Him then he struck
upon the last vertebra, in the joining of the head and neck, and he
disjoined both tendons; but the head, the mouth, and the nostrils of him
falling, met the ground much sooner than his legs and knees. Then Ajax
in turn cried out to blameless Polydamas:</p>
<p>“Reflect, O Polydamas, and tell me the truth; is not this man worthy to
be slain in exchange of Prothoënor? He appears not to me indeed a
coward, nor [sprung] from cowards, but [to be] the brother or the son of
horse-breaking Antenor, for he seems most like him as to his race.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, well knowing [him], but grief possessed the minds of the
Trojans. Then Acamas, stalking round his brother, wounded with his spear
Promachus, the Bœotian; whilst he was dragging him off by the feet. But
over him Acamas greatly boasted, calling out aloud:</p>
<p>“Ye Argive archers,<span id="footnotetag482"/>

alone will toil and sorrow accrue, but thus thou also wilt at some time
be slain. Consider how your Promachus sleeps, subdued by my spear, that
a requital for my brother might not be long unpaid. Therefore should a
man wish a brother to be left in his family, as an avenger of his
death.”</p>

<p>Thus he spoke; but grief arose among the Greeks as he boasted, and he
particularly agitated the mind of warlike Peneleus. Accordingly he
rushed upon Acamas, who awaited not the charge of king Peneleus; but he
wounded Ilioneus, son of Phorbas, rich in flocks, whom Mercury loved
most of all the Trojans, and had presented with possessions; and to whom
his mother bore Ilioneus alone. Him then he wounded below the brow, in
the socket of the eye, and he forced out the pupil: but the spear went
forward through the eye, and through the back of the head; and he sat
down, stretching out both his hands. But Peneleus, drawing his sharp
sword, smote him upon the middle of the neck, and lopped off his head
with its helmet to the ground, and the strong spear still remained in
his eye. But he (Peneleus), holding it up like a poppy, shouted to the
Trojans, and boasting spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Tell for me, ye Trojans, the beloved father and mother of illustrious
Ilioneus, that they may lament him in their halls; for neither shall the
wife of Promachus, the son of Alegenor, present herself with joy to her
dear husband coming [back], when we, sons of the Greeks, return from
Troy with our ships.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but pale fear seized upon them all, and each gazed about,
[seeking] where he might escape utter destruction.</p>
<p>Tell me now, ye muses, possessing Olympian dwellings, which of the
Greeks now first bore away gore-stained spoils of men, when the
illustrious Earth-shaker turned the [tide of] battle.</p>
<p>Telamonian Ajax then first wounded Hyrtius, son of Gyrtias, leader of
the undaunted Mysians; and Antilochus spoiled Phalces and Mermerus;
Meriones slew Morys and Hippotion; and Teucer slew Prothous and
Periphœtes. But the son of Atreus next wounded upon the flank Hyperenor,
the shepherd of the people, and the spear, cutting its way, drank his
entrails; and his soul, expelled, fled in haste through the inflicted
wound, and darkness veiled his eyes. But Ajax, the swift son of Oïleus,
slew the most; because there was not one equal to him on foot, to follow
the flying men, when Jove had excited flight amongst them.</p>
