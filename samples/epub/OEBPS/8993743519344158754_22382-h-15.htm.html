<h2>BOOK THE FIFTEENTH.</h2>
<h4 id="pgepubid00036">ARGUMENT.</h4>
<p>Jove awaking, and finding the Trojans routed, menaces Juno. He then
sends Iris to desire Neptune to relinquish the battle, and Apollo to
restore Hector to health. Armed with the ægis, Apollo puts the Greeks to
flight; who are pursued home to their fleet, while Telamonian Ajax slays
twelve Trojans who were bringing fire to burn it.</p>
<p class="p2">
But after the fugitives had crossed both the ramparts and the trench,
and many were subdued by the hands of the Greeks, the rest were at
length detained, waiting beside their chariots, pallid with fear, and
terrified. But Jove arose on the summits of Ida, from beside
golden-throned Juno; and starting up, he stood and beheld the Trojans
and Greeks, those indeed in confusion, and the Greeks throwing them into
confusion in the rear; and amongst them king Neptune. Hector he beheld
lying upon the plain, and his companions sat round him:<span id="footnotetag483"/>

who had wounded him. The father of men and gods, seeing, pitied him, and
sternly regarding Juno, severely addressed her:</p>
<p>“O Juno, of evil arts, impracticable, thy stratagem has made noble
Hector cease from battle, and put his troops to flight. Indeed I know
not whether again thou mayest not be the first to reap the fruits of thy
pernicious machinations, and I may chastise thee with stripes. Dost thou
not remember when thou didst swing from on high, and I hung two anvils
from thy feet, and bound a golden chain around thy hands, that could not
be broken? And thou didst hang in the air and clouds, and the gods
commiserated thee throughout lofty Olympus; but standing around, they
were not able to release thee; but whomsoever I caught, seizing, I
hurled from the threshold [of heaven], till he reached the earth, hardly
breathing. Nor even thus did my vehement anger, through grief for divine
Hercules, leave me; whom thou, prevailing upon the storms, with the
north wind, didst send over the unfruitful sea, designing evils, and
afterwards bore him out of his course, to well-inhabited Cos. I
liberated him, indeed, and brought him back thence to steed-nourishing
Argos, although having accomplished many toils. These things will I
again recall to thy memory, that thou mayest cease from deceits; in
order that thou mayest know whether the intercourse and a couch will
avail thee, in which thou wast mingled, coming apart from the gods, and
having deceived me.”</p>

<p>Thus he spoke; but venerable large-eyed Juno shuddered, and, addressing
him, spoke winged words:</p>
<p>“Be witness now, Earth, and boundless Heaven above, and the water of
Styx gliding beneath, which is the greatest and most dreaded oath
amongst the blessed gods; likewise thy sacred head, and our own nuptial
couch, by which I would not rashly swear at any time, that it is not by
my instigation that earth-shaking Neptune harasses the Trojans and
Hector, and aids the other side; but certainly his own mind incites and
orders him; for, beholding the Greeks oppressed at the ships, he took
compassion on them. And even him would I advise to go there, where thou,
O Cloud-collector, mayest command.”</p>
<p>Thus she spoke; but the father of men and gods smiled, and answering
her, spoke winged words:</p>
<p>“If indeed thou from henceforth, O venerable, large-eyed Juno, wouldst
sit amongst the immortals, being of the same mind with me, then truly
would Neptune, even although he very much wishes otherwise, immediately
change his mind to the same point, to thy wish and mine. But if indeed
thou speakest in sincerity and truly, go now to the assemblies of the
gods, and call Iris to come hither, and Apollo, renowned in archery,
that she may go to the people of the brazen-mailed Greeks, and tell king
Neptune, ceasing from battle, to repair to his own palaces; but let
Phœbus Apollo excite Hector to battle, and breathe strength into him
again, and make him forgetful of the pains which now afflict him in his
mind: but let him again put the Greeks to flight, exciting unwarlike
panic [amongst them], and, flying, let them fall back upon the
many-benched ships of Achilles, the son of Peleus. Then shall he
stimulate his companion Patroclus, whom illustrious Hector shall slay
with his spear before Ilium, [Patroclus] having slain many other youths,
and with them my son, noble Sarpedon; but noble Achilles shall slay
Hector. From this time forward will I always continually effect for
thee, that there shall be a retreat [of the Trojans] from the ships,
until the Greeks, by the counsels of Minerva, shall take lofty Ilium.
However, I shall not abate my anger, nor will I here permit any of the
immortals to assist the Greeks, before that the request of the son of
Peleus be completed; as first I promised to him, and nodded assent with
my head, on that day when the goddess Thetis touched my knees,
beseeching me that I would honour Achilles, the destroyer of cities.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, nor did the white-armed goddess Juno disobey, but went
down from the Idæan mountains to lofty Olympus. And as when the mind of
a man flashes swiftly [in thought], who, having traversed over many a
land, thinks within his prudent heart, “I was here, I was there,” and
deliberates much: thus quickly hastening, up sprung venerable Juno. But
she reached lofty Olympus, and came in upon the immortal gods, assembled
in the house of Jove but they beholding her, all rose up and welcomed
her with their cups. The rest, however, she neglected, but received a
goblet from fair-cheeked Themis; for she first running, came to meet
her, and addressing her, spoke winged words:</p>
<p>“Why, O Juno, hast thou come [hither], and art like unto one in
consternation? Has then the son of Saturn, who is thy husband, greatly
terrified thee?”</p>
<p>But her the white-armed goddess Juno then answered: “Do not, O goddess
Themis, ask me these things; even thou thyself knowest how overbearing
and cruel a spirit is his. But do thou preside over the equal feast, in
the palaces of the gods, and thou shalt hear these things along with all
the immortals, what evil deeds Jove denounces. Nor do I at all think
that the mind will equally rejoice to all, neither to mortals nor to the
gods, although some one even yet be feasting pleasantly.”</p>
<p>Thus having spoken, venerable Juno sat down; but the gods were grieved
throughout the palace of Jove. But she laughed with her lips [only], nor
was her forehead above her dark brows exhilarated;<span id="footnotetag485"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-15.htm.html#footnote485" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">485</sup></a> and, indignant,
she spoke amongst them all:</p>
<p>“Senseless we, who are thus foolishly enraged with father Jove! Of a
truth we still desire to restrain him, approaching near, either by
persuasion or by force; whilst he, sitting apart, does not regard, nor
is moved, for he says he is decidedly the most mighty in strength and
power among the immortal gods. Wherefore endure whatever evil he may
please to send upon each of you; for now already, I think, misfortune
hath been inflicted upon Mars, since his son has perished in the fight,
the dearest of mortals, Ascalaphus, whom impetuous Mars calls his own.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote485"/><b>Footnote 485:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-15.htm.html#footnotetag485" class="pginternal">
(return) </a> Compare Virg. Æn. i. 211: “Spem vultu simulat,
   premit altum corde dolorem” with Seneca ad Pol. 24. Nemesian.
   Eclog. iv. 17. “Quid vultu mentem premis, ac spem fronte
   serenas.” Liv. xxviii. 8: “Mœrebat quidem et angebatur.... in
   concilio tamen dissimulans ægritudinem, elato nimo disseruit.”</p>
<p>Thus she spake; but Mars smote his brawny thighs with his dropped hands,
and sorrowing, addressed them:</p>
<p>“Do not now blame me, ye who possess the Olympic mansions, repairing to
the ships of the Greeks, to avenge the slaughter of my son, even
although it should be my fate, smitten with the thunderbolt of Jove, to
lie together with the dead bodies in blood and dust.”</p>
<p>Thus he spake, and he commanded Fear and Flight to yoke his steeds, but
he himself girded on his shining armour. Then indeed some other greater
and more grievous wrath and indignation had fallen upon the immortals
from Jove, had not Minerva, greatly fearing for all the gods, leaped
forth from the vestibule, and left the throne where she sat. From his
head she snatched the helmet, and the shield from his shoulders, and
taking the brazen spear out of his strong hand, she placed it upright;
and rebuked impetuous Mars with [these] words:</p>
<p>“Infuriated one, infatuated in mind, thou art undone! are thy ears
indeed useless for hearing, and have thy sense and shame perished? Dost
thou not hear what the white-armed goddess Juno says, and she has just
now come from Olympian Jove? Dost thou thyself wish, having fulfilled
many misfortunes, to return to Olympus very much grieved, and by
compulsion, and also to create a great evil to all the rest? For he will
immediately leave the Trojans and magnanimous Greeks, and will come
against us, about to disturb us in Olympus; and will seize us one after
the other, whoever is culpable and who is not. Wherefore I exhort thee
now to lay aside thy wrath on account of thy son, for already some one,
even superior to him in strength and in hands, either is slain, or will
be hereafter; for it would be a difficult task to liberate [from death]
the race and offspring of all men.”</p>
<p>So saying, she seated impetuous Mars upon his throne. But Juno called
Apollo outside the house, and Iris, who is the messenger among the
immortal gods, and addressing them, spoke winged words:</p>
<p>“Jove orders you twain to repair with all haste to Ida, but when ye
arrive, and look upon the countenance of Jove, do whatsoever he may urge
and command.”</p>
<p>Then indeed, having thus spoken, venerable Juno retired, and sat down
upon her throne; but they, hastening, flew and arrived at Ida of many
rills, the mother of wild beasts. They found the far-seeing son of
Saturn sitting upon lofty Gargarus, and an odoriferous cloud encircled
him around. But coming before cloud-compelling Jove, they stood; nor was
he enraged in his mind, beholding them, because they quickly obeyed the
commands of his dear wife. And first to Iris he addressed winged words:</p>
<p>“Haste, begone, fleet Iris, tell all these things to king Neptune, nor
be thou a false messenger. Order him, having ceased from the battle and
the war, to repair to the assemblies of the gods, or to the vast sea.
If, however, he will not obey my words, but shall despise them, let him
then consider in his mind and soul, lest, however powerful he may be, he
may not be able to withstand me coming against him; for I say that I am
superior to him in strength, and elder in birth; but his heart fears
riot to assert himself equal to me, whom even the others dread.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, nor was wind-footed, swift Iris disobedient: but she
descended from the Idæan mountains to sacred Ilium. And as when snow
drifts from the clouds, or cold hail, by the impulse of
cloud-dispelling<span id="footnotetag486"/>

along, and standing near illustrious Neptune, she addressed him:</p>
<p>“O azure-haired Earth-shaker, I have come hither, bringing a certain
message to thee from ægis-bearing Jove. He has commanded thee, having
ceased from the battle and the war, to repair either to the assemblies
of the gods or to the vast sea. But if thou wilt not obey his words, but
shalt despise them, he threatens that he will come hither himself to
fight against thee; and advises thee to avoid his hands, because he
asserts that he is greatly superior to thee in strength, and elder in
birth: but thy heart does not fear to profess that thou art equal to
him, whom even the others dread.”</p>
<p>But her illustrious Neptune, greatly indignant, then addressed: “Gods!
powerful though he be, he surely has spoken proudly, if he will by force
restrain me unwilling, who am of equal honour. For we are three brothers
[descended] from Saturn, whom Rhea brought forth: Jupiter and I, and
Pluto, governing the infernal regions, the third; all things were
divided into three parts, and each was allotted his dignity.<span id="footnotetag487"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-15.htm.html#footnote487" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">487</sup></a> I in
the first place, the lots being shaken, was allotted to inhabit for ever
the hoary sea, and Pluto next obtained the pitchy darkness; but Jove in
the third place had allotted to him the wide heaven in the air and in
the clouds. Nevertheless the earth is still the common property of all,
and lofty Olympus. Wherefore I shall not live according to the will of
Jove, but although being very powerful, let him remain quiet in his
third part; and let him by no means terrify me as a coward with his
hands. For it would be better for him to insult with terrific language
the daughters and sons whom he hath begotten, who will also through
necessity attend to him, exhorting them.”</p>
<p>But him the fleet wind-footed Iris then answered: “O<span id="footnotetag488"/>

<p>But her again earth-shaking Neptune in turn addressed: “Goddess Iris,
very rightly hast thou delivered this opinion; moreover, it is good when
a messenger knows fitting things. But on this account severe indignation
comes upon my heart and soul, because he wishes to chide with angry
words me, equal to him by lot, and doomed to an equal destiny.
Nevertheless, at present, although being indignant, I will give way. But
another thing will I tell thee, and I will threaten this from my soul;
if indeed, without me and prey-hunting Minerva, Juno, Mercury, and king
Vulcan, he shall spare lofty Ilium, nor shall wish to destroy it, and
give great glory to the Greeks; let him know this, that endless
animosity shall arise between us.”</p>
<p>So saying, the Earth-shaker quitted the Grecian army, and proceeding, he
plunged into the deep; but the Grecian heroes longed for him. And then
cloud-compelling Jove addressed Apollo:</p>
<p>“Go now, dear Phœbus, to brazen-helmed Hector; for already hath
earth-encircling Neptune departed to the vast sea, avoiding our dreadful
anger; for otherwise the rest, who are infernal gods, being around
Saturn, would surely have heard our quarrel. This, however, is much
better for me as well as for himself, that he hath first yielded to my
hands, accounting himself worthy of blame, because the matter would not
have been accomplished without sweat. But do thou take the fringed ægis
in thy hands, with which, by violently shaking it, do thou greatly
terrify the Grecian heroes. To thyself, however, O far-darting [Apollo],
let illustrious Hector be a care. So long then arouse his great might
unto him, until the Greeks in flight reach the ships and the Hellespont.
Thenceforth I shall myself deliberate in deed and word, how the Greeks
also may revive from labour.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, nor did Apollo disobey his sire, but he descended from
the Idæan mountains like unto a swift hawk the dove-destroyer, the
swiftest of birds. He found the son of warlike Priam, noble Hector,
sitting; for he no longer lay [on the ground], but had just collected
his senses, recognizing his friends around him. But the panting and
perspiration had ceased, since the will of ægis-bearing Jove had aroused
him. Then far-darting Apollo, standing near, addressed him:</p>
<p>“Hector, son of Priam, why sittest thou apart from the rest, failing in
strength? Has any grief invaded thee?”</p>
<p>But him then crest-tossing Hector languidly addressed: “And who art
thou, best of the gods, who inquirest face to face? Hast thou not heard
that Ajax, brave in the din of battle, smote me with a stone upon the
breast, and caused me to cease from impetuous valour, when slaying his
companions at the sterns of the Grecian ships? And truly I thought that
I should this day behold the dead, and the mansion of Pluto, since I was
[on the point of] breathing out my dear life.”</p>
<p>But him far-darting king Apollo addressed in turn: “Be of good courage
now, so great an assistant has the son of Saturn sent forth from Ida to
stand up and help thee, Phœbus Apollo, of the golden sword: who am
accustomed to defend at the same time thyself and the lofty city. But
come, encourage now thy numerous cavalry to drive their fleet steeds
towards the hollow ships; but I, going before, will level the whole way
for the horses, and I will turn to flight the Grecian heroes.”</p>
<p>Thus speaking, he inspired great strength into the shepherd of the
people. As when some stalled horse, fed on barley<span id="footnotetag490"/>

to the accustomed places and pasture of the mares: so Hector swiftly
moved his feet and knees, encouraging the horsemen, after he had heard
the voice of the god. But they—as dogs and rustic men rush against
either a horned stag or wild goat; which however a lofty rock and shady
forest protect, nor is it destined for them to catch it; but at their

back, although ardently pursuing: thus the Greeks hitherto indeed ever
kept following in troops, striking with their swords and double-edged

<p>Then Thoas, the son of Andræmon, addressed them, by far the bravest of
the Ætolians, skilled in the use of the javelin, and brave in the
standing fight; few also of the Greeks excelled him in the council when
the youths contended in eloquence. Who wisely counselling, harangued
them, and said:</p>
<p>“O gods, surely I behold with mine eyes this mighty miracle, since
Hector has thus risen again, having escaped death. Certainly the mind of
each was in great hopes that he had died by the hands of Telamonian
Ajax. But some one of the gods has again liberated and preserved Hector,
who hath already relaxed the knees of many Greeks; as I think is about
[to occur] now also, for not without far-sounding Jove does he stand in
the van, thus earnest. But come, let us all obey as I shall desire. Let
us order the multitude to retreat towards the ships. But let us, as many
as boast ourselves to be the best in the army, take a stand, if indeed,
opposing, we may at the outset interrupt him, upraising our spears; and
I think that he, although raging, will dread in mind to enter the band
of the Greeks.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but all heard him attentively, and obeyed. Those around
the Ajaces and king Idomeneus, Teucer, Meriones, and Meges, equal to
Mars, calling the chiefs together, marshalled their lines against Hector
and the Trojans; whilst the multitude in the rear retreated to the ships
of the Greeks. But the Trojans in close array pressed forward; and
Hector, taking long strides, led the way; but before him walked Phœbus
Apollo, clad as to his shoulders with a cloud,<span id="footnotetag493"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-15.htm.html#footnote493" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">493</sup></a> and he held the

had given to Jove, to be borne along for the routing of men. Holding
this in his hands, he led on the people. But the Greeks remained in
close array, and a shrill shout arose on both sides. [Many] arrows
bounded from the strings, and many spears from gallant hands: some were
fixed in the bodies of warlike youths, but many half way, before they
had touched the fair body, stuck in the earth, longing to satiate
themselves with flesh. As long as Phœbus Apollo held the ægis unmoved in
his hands, so long did the weapons reach both sides, and the people
fell. But when, looking full in the faces of the swift-horsed Greeks, he
shook it, and he himself besides shouted very loudly, then he checked
the courage in their breasts, and they became forgetful of impetuous
valour. But they, as when two wild beasts, in the depth of the dark
night,<span id="footnotetag495"/>

suddenly upon them, the keeper not being present—so the enfeebled
Greeks were routed; for amongst them Apollo sent terror, and gave glory
to the Trojans and to Hector. Then indeed man slew man, when the battle
gave way. Hector slew Stichius and Arcesilaus; the one the leader of the
brazen-mailed Bœotians; but the other the faithful companion of
magnanimous Menestheus. But Æneas slew Medon and Iasus: Medon indeed was
the illegitimate son of godlike Oïleus, and brother of Ajax; and he
dwelt in Phylace, away from his father-land, having slain a man, the
brother of his stepmother Eriopis, whom Oïleus had betrothed. Iasus,
however, was appointed leader of the Athenians, and was called the son
of Sphelus, the son of Bucolus. But Polydamas slew Mecistis, and Polites
Echius, in the van, and noble Agenor slew Klonius. Paris also wounded
Dëiochous in the extremity of the shoulder from behind, whilst he was
flying amongst the foremost combatants; and drove the brass quite
through.</p>

<p>Whilst they were spoiling these of their armour, the Greeks in the
meantime falling into the dug trench and stakes, fled here and there;
and from necessity entered within the rampart. But Hector, shouting
aloud, exhorted the Trojans to rush upon the ships, and to let go the
bloody spoils: “And whatever person I<span id="footnotetag496"/>

<p>So saying, with the lash upon the shoulder he drove on his horses
against the ranks, cheering on the Trojans; but they all shouting along
with him, directed their car-drawing steeds with a mighty clamour. But
Phœbus Apollo in front of them, easily overthrowing the banks of the
deep ditch with his feet, cast [them] into the middle; and bridged a
causeway long and wide, as far as the cast of a spear reaches, when a
man, making trial of his strength, hurls it. In that way they poured
onward by troops, and Apollo [went] before them, holding the
highly-prized ægis. But he overthrew the wall of the Greeks very easily,
as when any boy does the sand from the shore; who, when amusing himself
in childishness he has made playthings, again destroys them with his
feet and hands. Thus, O archer Phœbus, didst thou destroy the great
labour and toil of the Greeks, and didst excite flight amongst
themselves. In this manner indeed, remaining, they were penned up at the
ships; animating each other, and raising up their hands to all the gods,
they each loudly offered vows. But the guardian of the Greeks, Gerenian
Nestor, most particularly prayed, stretching forth his hands to the
starry heaven: “O father Jove, if ever any one in fruitful Argos, to
thee burning the fat thighs of either oxen or sheep, supplicated that he
might return, and thou didst promise and assent; be mindful of these
things, O Olympian, and avert the cruel day; nor thus permit the Greeks
to be subdued by the Trojans.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, praying: but provident Jove loudly thundered, hearing the
prayers of the Neleïan old man. But the Trojans, when they understood
the will of ægis-bearing Jove, rushed the more against the Greeks, and
were mindful of battle. And as a mighty wave of the wide-flowing ocean
dashes over the sides of a ship, when the force of the wind impels it
(for that most of all increases waves); so the Trojans with a mighty
shout mounted over the wall. And having driven in their horses, they
fought at the sterns, hand to hand with two-edged spears, the one party
from their chariots, but the other on high from their black ships,
having ascended them with long poles which lay in their vessels, for
fighting by sea, well glued, and clad on the tip with brass.</p>
<p>But Patroclus, as long indeed as the Greeks and Trojans fought round
the wall, without the swift ships, so long he sat in the tent of
valour-loving Eurypylus, and delighted him with his discourse; and to
the severe wound he applied medicines, assuagers of dark pains. But when
he perceived that the Trojans had burst within the walls, and moreover
that a clamour and flight of the Greeks had arisen, then indeed he
groaned, and smote both his thighs with his downward-bent hands; and
lamenting spoke:</p>
<p>“O Eurypylus, I cannot any longer remain here with thee, although
needing much, for now has a mighty contest arisen. But let thy attendant
entertain thee, and I will hasten to Achilles, that I may encourage him
to fight. And who knows whether, with God’s assistance, persuading, I
may move his soul? for the admonition of a companion is effectual.” But
him his feet then bore away thus speaking. Meanwhile the Greeks firmly
withstood the Trojans rushing on, nor were they able to repel them from
the ships, although being fewer; nor could the Trojans, breaking through
the phalanxes of the Greeks, be mingled with the tents or ships. But as
a plumb-line in the hands of a skilful shipwright (who knows well the
whole art by the precepts of Minerva) correctly adjusts the naval plank,
so was the battle and war equally extended. Some indeed supported the
conflict round one ship, and others round another, but Hector advanced
against glorious Ajax. Thus these two undertook the task round one ship,
nor were they able, the one to drive the other away and burn the ship
with fire, nor the other to repulse him, since a divinity had brought
him near. Then illustrious Ajax smote upon the breast with his spear
Caletor, son of Clytius, bearing fire against the ship; and falling, he
resounded, and the torch fell from his hand. But when Hector perceived
with his eyes his cousin fallen in the dust before the black ship, he
cheered on the Trojans and Lycians, loudly exclaiming:</p>
<p>“Ye Trojans and Lycians, and close-fighting Dardanians, do not now
retire from the fight in this narrow pass. But preserve the son of
Clytius, lest the Greeks despoil him of his armour, having fallen in the
contest at the ships.” Thus having spoken, he took aim with his shining
spear at Ajax, whom he missed; but [he smote] Lycophron, the son of
Mastor, the servant of Ajax, a Cytherean, who dwelt with him, since he
had killed a man amongst the celebrated Cythereans. He struck him on the
head over the ear, with the sharp brass, whilst he was standing near
Ajax: but he fell supine to the ground from the stern of the ship in the
dust, and his limbs were relaxed. Then Ajax shuddered, and accosted his
brother: “Dear Teucer, now is our faithful companion, the son of Mastor,
whom being domesticated in Cythera, we honoured equally with our beloved
parents in our palaces; but him magnanimous Hector has slain. Where now
are thy death-bearing arrows and bow, which Phœbus Apollo gave thee?”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but he understood; and running, he stood near him,
holding in his hand his bent bow, and arrow-bearing quiver; and very
quickly he shot his arrows amongst the Trojans. He struck Clitus, the
illustrious son of Pisenor, the companion of Polydamas, the renowned son
of Panthous, holding the reins in his hands. He indeed was employed in
[guiding] the horses; for he directed them there, where the most
numerous phalanxes were thrown in confusion, gratifying Hector and the
Trojans. But soon came evil upon him, which no one averted from him,
although eager; for the bitter shaft fell upon his neck from behind, and
he fell from the chariot, whilst his horses started back, rattling the
empty car. But king Polydamas very quickly perceived it, and first came
to meet his horses. Them he intrusted to Astynous, son of Protiaon, and
exhorted him much to keep the horses near him within sight; but he
himself returning was mingled with the foremost combatants. Teucer,
however, drew another arrow against brazen-armed Hector, and would have
made him cease from battle, at the ships of the Greeks, if striking him
while bravely fighting, he had taken away his life. But it did not
escape the prudent mind of Jove, who protected Hector, and deprived
Teucer, the son of Telamon, of glory; and who (Jove) broke the
well-twisted string, in his blameless bow, as he was drawing against
[Hector]; but the brass-laden arrow was turned off in another direction,
and the bow fell from his hand. Then Teucer shuddered, and addressed his
brother:</p>
<p>“Ye gods! a deity, without doubt, cuts short the plans of our battle,
who has shaken the bow from my hand, and has snapped asunder the
newly-twisted string which I tied to it this morning, that it might
sustain the shafts frequently bounding from it.”</p>
<p>But him the mighty Telamonian Ajax then answered: “O my friend, permit
then thy bow and numerous arrows to lie aside, since a god has
confounded them, envying the Greeks; but, taking a long spear in thy
hands, and a shield upon thy shoulder, fight against the Trojans, and
encourage the other forces. Nor let them take the well-benched ships
without labour at least, although having subdued us, but let us be
mindful of the fight.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; and he placed his bow within the tents. Then around his
shoulders he hung a four-fold shield, and upon his brave head fixed a
well-made helmet, crested with horse-hair, and the plume nodded
dreadfully from above. And he grasped a stout spear, tipped with sharp
brass, and hastened to advance, and running very quickly, stood beside
Ajax. But when Hector perceived the arrows of Teucer frustrated, he
encouraged the Trojans and Lycians, calling aloud:</p>
<p>“Ye Trojans, Lycians, and close-fighting Dardanians, be men, my friends,
and be mindful of impetuous valour at the hollow ships; for I have
beheld with my eyes the arrows of their chief warrior rendered vain by
Jove. Easily recognizable amongst men is the power of Jove, as well
among those into whose hands he has delivered superior glory, as those
whom he deteriorates, and does not wish to defend. As now he diminishes
the might of the Greeks, and aids us. But fight in close array at the
ships, and whichever of you, wounded or stricken, shall draw on his
death and fate, let him die; it is not inglorious to him to die fighting
for his country; but his wife shall be safe, and his children left
behind him, his house and patrimony unimpaired, if indeed the Greeks
depart with their ships to their dear father-land.”</p>
<p>So saying, he kindled the strength and spirit of each: and Ajax again,
on the other side, animated his companions:</p>
<p>“Shame, oh Argives! now is the moment for us either to perish, or to be
preserved and to repel destruction from the ships. Do ye expect that if
crest-tossing Hector capture the ships, ye will reach on foot each his
native land? Do ye not hear Hector, who now rages to fire the ships,
inciting all his people? Nor indeed does he invite them to come to a
dance, but to battle. But for us there is no opinion or design better
than this, to join in close fight our hands and strength. Better, either
to perish at once, or live, rather than thus uselessly to be wasted
away<span id="footnotetag497"/>

<p>So saying, he aroused the strength and courage of each. Then Hector
indeed slew Schedius, son of Perimedes, prince of the Phoceans; and Ajax
slew Laodamas, leader of the infantry, the illustrious son of Antenor.
Polydamas slew Cyllenian Otus, the companion of the son of Phyleus,
chief of the magnanimous Epeans. Meges rushed upon him, perceiving it,
but Polydamas stooped obliquely, and he missed him; for Apollo did not
suffer the son of Panthous to be subdued among the foremost warriors.
But he wounded Crœsmus in the middle of the breast with his spear, but
falling, he resounded; and he stripped the arms from his shoulders. In
the meantime Dolops, the descendant of Lampus, well skilled in the
spear, leaped upon him (he whom Lampus, son of Laomedon, the best of
men, begat, skilled in impetuous fight), who then attacking him in close
fight, struck the middle of Meges’s shield with his spear: but the thick
corslet defended him, which he wore, compact in its cavities. This
Phyleus formerly brought from Ephyre, from the river Selleïs: for his
host, Euphetes, king of men, had given it to him, to bear into the
battle as a defence against the enemy; and which then warded off
destruction from the body of his son. But Meges with his sharp spear
smote the base of the highest cone of his brazen horse-haired helmet,
and struck off his horse-haired crest; and the whole fell on the ground
in the dust, lately shining with purple. Whilst the one (Meges) standing
firm, fought with the other (Dolops), and still expected victory;
meanwhile, warlike Menelaus came as an assistant to him (Meges), and
stood at his side with his spear, escaping notice, and wounded him from
behind in the shoulder; but the spear, driven with violence, passed
through his breast, proceeding farther; and he fell on his face. Both
then rushed on, about to tear the brazen armour from his shoulders; but
Hector strenuously exhorted all his relations, and rebuked the gallant
Melanippus first, the son of Hicetaon. He till then had fed his
curved-footed oxen at Percote, the enemy being yet at a distance; but
when the equally-plied barks of the Greeks had arrived, he came back to
Troy, and was distinguished amongst the Trojans; and he dwelt near
Priam, and he honoured him equally with his sons. But Hector rebuked
him; and spoke and addressed him:</p>
<p>“Shall we be thus remiss, O Melanippus? Is not thy heart moved, thy
kinsman being slain? Dost thou not perceive how busy they are about the
arms of Dolops? But follow; for it is no longer justifiable to fight at
a distance with the Greeks, before that either we slay them, or that
they tear lofty Ilium from its summit, and slay its citizens.” So
saying, he led on, and the godlike hero followed with him. But mighty
Telamonian Ajax aroused the Greeks.</p>

<p>Thus he spoke, but they too were eager to repel [the enemy]. And they
fixed his advice in their mind, and enclosed the ships with a brazen
fence; but Jove urged on the Trojans. And Menelaus, brave in the din of
battle, incited Antilochus:</p>
<p>“O Antilochus, no other of the Greeks is younger than thou, nor swifter
of foot, nor strong, as thou [art], to fight. Would<span id="footnotetag499"/>

<p>So saying, he on his part withdrew again, and he aroused him. But he
(Antilochus) leaped forth from amongst the foremost warriors, and took
aim with his shining spear, gazing around him; but the Trojans retired,
the hero hurling. But he did not cast his weapon in vain, for he struck
magnanimous Melanippus, the son of Hicetaon, in the breast, near the
pap, advancing to the battle. And falling, he made a crash, and his arms
rang upon him. But Antilochus sprang upon him, as a dog that rushes on a
wounded fawn, which the huntsman aiming at, has wounded, leaping from
its lair, and relaxed its limbs under it. Thus, O Melanippus, did
warlike Antilochus spring on thee, about to despoil thee of thy armour:
but he did not escape noble Hector, who came against him, running
through the battle. But Antilochus did not await him, though being an
expert warrior, but he fled, like unto a wild beast that has done some
mischief, which, having slain a dog or herdsman in charge of oxen,
flies, before a crowd of men is assembled: so fled the son of Nestor;
but the Trojans and Hector, with great clamour, poured forth their
deadly weapons. Yet when he reached the band of his own companions,
being turned round, he stood. But the Trojans, like raw-devouring lions,
rushed upon the ships, and were fulfilling the commands of Jove; who
ever kept exciting their great strength, and enervated the courage of
the Greeks, and took away their glory; but encouraged those. For his
mind wished to bestow glory on Hector, the son of Priam, that he might
cast the dreadfully-burning, indefatigable fire upon the crooked barks;
and accomplish all the unseasonable prayer of Thetis.</p>
<p>For this did provident Jove await, till he should behold with his eyes
the flame of a burning vessel; for from that time he was about to make a
retreat of the Trojans from the ships, and to afford glory to the
Greeks. Designing these things, he aroused Hector, the son of Priam,
against the hollow ships, although himself very eager. But he raged, as
when Mars [rages], brandishing his spear, or [when] a destructive fire
rages in the mountains, in the thickets of a deep wood. And foam arose
about his mouth, and his eyes flashed from beneath his grim eyebrows;
and the helm was shaken awfully upon the temples of Hector, fighting;
for Jove himself from the æther was an assistant to him, and honoured
and glorified him alone amongst many men; because he was destined to be
short-lived: for Pallas Minerva already impelled him towards the fatal
day, by the might of the son of Peleus. And he wished to break the ranks
of heroes, trying them, wheresoever he beheld the greatest crowd and the
best arms. But not thus was he able to break through them, although very
eager; for they, compact in squares, sustained his attack, as a lofty,
huge cliff, being near the hoary deep, which abides the impetuous
inroads of the shrill winds, and the swollen billows which are dashed
against it. Thus the Greeks firmly awaited the Trojans, nor fled. But
he, gleaming with fire on all sides, rushed upon the crowd; and fell
upon them, as when an impetuous wave, wind-nurtured from the clouds,
dashes against a swift ship, and it [the ship] is wholly enveloped with
the spray, and a dreadful blast of wind roars within the sail: but the
sailors tremble in mind, fearing, because they are borne but a little
way from death: thus was the mind of the Greeks divided in their
breasts. He, however, like a destructive lion coming upon oxen which
feed in myriads in the moist ground of a spacious marsh, and amongst
them a keeper not very skilful in fighting with a wild beast for the
slaughter of a crooked-horned ox;<span id="footnotetag500"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-15.htm.html#footnote500" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">500</sup></a> he indeed always accompanies the
foremost or the hindmost cattle, whilst [the lion] springing into the
midst, devours an ox, and all the rest fly in terror; thus then were the
Greeks wondrously put to flight by Hector and father Jove, all—but
[Hector] slew only Mycenæan Periphetes, the dear son of Copreus, who
went with a messenger of king Eurystheus to mighty Hercules. From this
far inferior father sprung a son superior in all kinds of
accomplishments, as well in the race as in the combat, and who in
prudence was among the first of the Mycenæans, who at that time gave
into the hands of Hector superior glory. For, turning backwards, he trod
upon the rim of his shield which he bore, a fence against javelins,
which reached to his feet; by this incommoded, he fell upon his back,
and the helmet terribly sounded round the temples of him fallen. But
Hector quickly perceived, and running, stood near him, and fixed his
spear in his breast, and slew him near his beloved companions, nor
indeed were they able, although grieved for their comrade, to avail him,
for they themselves greatly feared noble Hector. But they retreated
within the line of their ships,<span id="footnotetag501"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-15.htm.html#footnote501" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">501</sup></a> and the extreme ships enclosed
them, which were first drawn up: and the others were poured in. The
Argives, therefore, from necessity, retreated from the foremost vessels,
and remained there at their tents in close array, and were not dispersed
through the camp, for shame and fear restrained them, and they
unceasingly exhorted one another with shouting. More particularly did
Gerenian Nestor, the guardian of the Greeks, adjure them by their
parents, earnestly supplicating each man:</p>
<p>“O my friends, be men, and place a sense of reverence<span id="footnotetag502"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-15.htm.html#footnote502" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">502</sup></a> of other men
in your minds. Call to memory, each of you, your children, wives,
property, and parents, as well he to whom they survive as he to whom
they are dead; for by those not present I here supplicate you to stand
bravely, nor be ye turned to flight.” So saying, he aroused the might
and spirit of each. But for them Minerva removed the heaven-sent cloud
of darkness from their eyes; and abundant light arose to them on both
sides, both towards the ships and towards the equally destructive
battle. Then they observed Hector, brave in the din of battle, and his
companions, as well whatever of them stood behind and did not fight as
those who fought the battle at the swift ships. Nor was it longer
pleasing to the mind of great-hearted Ajax to stand there where the
other sons of the Greeks stood together; but he went about upon the
decks of the vessels, taking long strides, and wielding in his hands a
great sea-fighting pole, studded with iron nails, twenty-two cubits
long. And as when a man well skilled in vaulting upon steeds, who, after
he has selected four horses out of a greater number, driving them from
the plain, urges them towards a mighty city, along the public way; and
him many men and women behold with admiration; but he, always leaping up
firmly and safely, changes alternately from one to the other,<span id="footnotetag503"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-15.htm.html#footnote503" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">503</sup></a>
whilst they are flying along: so went Ajax along many decks of swift
ships, shouting loudly, and his voice reached to the sky; and, always
terribly shouting, he ordered the Greeks to defend their ships and
tents. Nor, indeed, did Hector remain among the crowd of well-corsleted
Trojans; but as the tawny eagle pounces upon a flock of winged birds,
feeding on a river’s bank, either geese or cranes, or long-necked swans,
so did Hector direct his course towards an azure-prowed vessel, rushing
against it; but Jove, with a very mighty hand, impelled him from behind,
and animated his forces along with him. Again was a sharp contest waged
at the ships. You would have said that unwearied and indefatigable they
met each other in battle, so furiously they fought. And to them fighting
this was the opinion: the Greeks, indeed, thought that they could not
escape from destruction, but must perish. But the soul of each within
his breast, to the Trojans, hoped to burn the ships, and slay the
Grecian heroes. They thinking these things, opposed one another.</p>

against the Greeks. Even Ajax no longer sustained them, for he was
overwhelmed with darts; but, thinking he should fall, retired back a
short space to the seven-feet bench, and deserted the deck of his equal
ship. There he stood watching, and with his spear continually repulsed
the Trojans from the ships, whoever might bring the indefatigable fire;
and always shouting dreadfully, he animated the Greeks:</p>
<p>“O my friends, Grecian heroes, servants of Mars, be men, my friends, and
be mindful of impetuous strength. Whether do we think that we have any
assistants in the rear, or any stronger rampart which may avert
destruction from the men? Indeed there is not any other city near,
fortified with towers, where we may be defended, having a reinforcing
army; but bordering on the sea, we sit in the plain of the well-armed
Trojans, far away from our native land; therefore safety is in our
exertions, not in remission of battle.”</p>
<p>He said, and furious, charged with his sharp spear whoever of the
Trojans was borne towards the hollow ships with burning fire, for the
sake of Hector who incited them;—him Ajax wounded, receiving him with
his long spear; and he slew twelve in close fight before the ships.</p>

   sketch of this hero’s deification after death in Philostratus’s
   preface to the Heroica. He was the first of the Greeks who fell,
