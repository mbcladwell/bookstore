<h2>BOOK THE SIXTEENTH.</h2>
<h4 id="pgepubid00038">ARGUMENT.</h4>
<p>Patroclus at length obtains permission from Achilles, and enters the
fight, on condition that he should return after liberating the Greeks
from their immediate peril. He comes opportunely to the assistance of
Ajax, routs the Trojans, and kills Sarpedon, whose body, but without the
armour, is rescued by Hector and Glaucus. Forgetful of his promise to
Achilles, Patroclus pursues the Trojans to their very walls. He is
driven back by Apollo, but slays the charioteer of Hector, Cebriones. He
is suddenly afflicted with stupor by Apollo, and dies by the hand of
Hector, whose death he foretells. Hector pursues Automedon with the
chariot of Achilles towards the ships.</p>
<p class="p2">
Thus, then, they were fighting for the well-benched ship. But Patroclus
stood beside Achilles, the shepherd of the people, shedding warm<span id="footnotetag508"/>

tears; as a black-water fountain, which pours its sable tide down from a
lofty rock. But swift-footed noble Achilles, seeing, pitied him, and
addressing him, spoke winged words:</p>
<p>“Why weepest thou, O Patroclus, as an infant girl, who, running along
with her mother, importunes to be taken up, catching her by the robe,
and detains her hastening; and weeping, looks at her [mother] till she
is taken up?—like unto her, O Patroclus, dost thou shed the tender
tear. Dost thou bear any tidings to the Myrmidons, or to me myself? Or
hast thou alone heard any news from Phthia? They say that, indeed,
Menœtius, the son of Actor, still lives, and that Peleus, the son of
Æacus, lives amongst the Myrmidons: for deeply should we lament for
either of them dying. Or dost thou mourn for the Greeks, because they
thus perish at their hollow ships, on account of their injustice? Speak
out, nor conceal it in thy mind, that we both may know.”</p>

<p>But deeply sighing, O knight Patroclus, him thou didst address: “O
Achilles, son of Peleus, by far the bravest of the Greeks, be not
indignant; since a grief so heavy does oppress the Greeks: for now all
they, as many as were formerly most valiant, lie in the ships, wounded
or stricken. Brave Diomede, indeed, the son of Tydeus, is wounded, and
spear-renowned Ulysses is stricken, as also Agamemnon; and Eurypylus is
also wounded in the thigh with an arrow. About these, indeed, physicians
skilled in many remedies are employed healing their wounds: but thou, O
Achilles, art inexorable. Never may such anger seize me at least, as
thee, O cruelly brave, dost preserve. What other after-born man will be
defended by thee, if thou will not avert unworthy ruin from the Greeks?
merciless one! Certainly the knight Peleus was not thy father, nor
Thetis thy mother; but the grey<span id="footnotetag509"/>

rocks; for thy mind is cruel. But if thou wouldst avoid any oracle in
thy mind, and thy venerable mother has told any to thee from Jove, at
least send me quickly, and at the same time give me the rest of the army
of the Myrmidons, if perchance I may become any aid to the Greeks. Grant
me also to be armed on my shoulders with thy armour, if perchance the
Trojans, likening me to thee, may cease from battle, and the warlike
sons of the Greeks, now fatigued, breathe again; and there be a short
respite from war.<span id="footnotetag510"/>

<p>“This to me is a bitter grief, since I have suffered sorrows in my mind.

enraged in one’s mind. Certainly I affirmed that I would not put a stop
to my wrath, before that clamour and war should reach my ships. But do
thou put on thy shoulders my famous armour, and lead on the war-loving
Myrmidons to battle; since now a black cloud of Trojans hath strongly
surrounded the ships, and the Greeks are hemmed in by the shore of the
sea, possessing now but a small portion of land. And the whole city of
the Trojans has rushed on, confident, because they behold not the front
of my helmet gleaming near. Certainly, quickly flying, would they have
filled the trenches with their bodies, if king Agamemnon had known
mildness to me: but now they are fighting around the army. For the spear
does not rage in the hands of Diomede, the son of Tydeus, to avert
destruction from the Greeks: nor do I at all hear the voice of Agamemnon
shouting from his odious head; but [the voice] of man-slaughtering
Hector, animating the Trojans, resounds: whilst they with a shout
possess the whole plain, conquering the Greeks in battle. Yet even thus,
Patroclus, do thou fall on them bravely, warding off destruction from
the ships; nor let them consume the vessels with blazing fire, and cut
off thy own return. But obey, as I shall lay the sum of my advice in thy
mind, in order that thou mayest obtain for me great honour and glory
from all the Greeks; and they may send back to me the beautiful maid,
and afford [me] besides rich presents. Having repulsed the enemy from
the ships, return back: and if, indeed, the loud-thundering husband of
Juno permit thee to obtain glory, do not be desirous of fighting with
the warlike Trojans apart from me; for thou wouldst render me more
dishonoured; nor, exulting in the battle and havoc, lead on as far as
Ilium, slaughtering the Trojans, lest some of the immortal gods come
down from Olympus [against thee]; for far-darting Apollo greatly loves
them. But return after thou hast given safety to the ships, and allow
the others to contend through the plain. For would that, O father Jove,
Minerva, and Apollo, not one of the Trojans, as many as there are, may
escape death, nor any of the Greeks: whilst to us two it [may be
granted] to avoid destruction, that we alone might overthrow the sacred
bulwarks of Troy.”</p>

the counsel of Jove overpowered him, and the fierce Trojans hurling. And
a dreadful clang did his glittering helmet round his temples emit, being
struck, and he was constantly smitten upon the well-made studs of his
casque. He was fatigued in the left shoulder, by always firmly holding
his moveable shield; nor could they, pressing him all around with their
weapons, drive him [from his place]. Unceasingly afflicted was he with
severe panting, and everywhere from his limbs poured copious
perspiration, nor was he able to respire; for everywhere evil was heaped
upon evil.</p>

Cf. Virg. Æn. ix. 806, sqq.; Stat. Theb. ii. 668, sqq.</p>
<p>Declare now to me, ye Muses, possessing Olympic habitations, how first
the fire fell upon the ships of the Greeks!</p>
<p>Hector, standing near, struck the ashen spear of Ajax with his great
sword, at the socket of the blade behind, and cut it quite off;
Telamonian Ajax indeed vainly brandished the mutilated spear in his
hand; but the brazen blade rang, falling upon the earth at a distance
from him. Then Ajax knew in his blameless soul, and shuddered at the
deeds of the gods; because the lofty thundering Jove cut off his plans
of war, and willed the victory to the Trojans. Wherefore he retired out
of the reach of the weapons, and they hurled the indefatigable fire at
the swift ships, the inextinguishable flame of which was immediately
diffused around. Thus indeed the flame surrounded the stern; but
Achilles, smiting his thighs, addressed Patroclus:</p>
<p>“Haste, O most noble steed-directing Patroclus (I perceive, indeed, the
fury of the hostile fire at the ships), lest they now take the vessels,
and there be not an opportunity of flying; put on thy armour very
quickly, and I shall assemble the forces.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but Patroclus armed himself in glittering brass. First,
indeed, he put the beautiful greaves around his legs, fitted with
clasps; next he placed the corslet of the swift-footed descendant of
Æacus upon his breast, variegated, and studded with stars; and suspended
from his shoulders his silver-studded sword, brazen, and then the great
and sturdy shield. But upon his gallant head he placed the well-made
helmet, crested with horse-hair; and dreadfully the plume nodded from
above. He took besides two strong spears, which well fitted his hands;
but the spear alone of blameless Æacides, ponderous, large, and strong,
he did not take; which, indeed, no other of the Greeks could brandish,
but Achilles alone knew how to wield it; a Pelian ash which Chiron had
given to his sire, [cut] from the tops of Pelion, about to be death to
heroes. He also commanded Automedon quickly to yoke the steeds, whom,
next to rank-breaking Achilles, he most honoured, because he was most
faithful to him in battle, to stand the charge. Wherefore Automedon
yoked the fleet horses, Xanthus and Balius, which kept pace with the
winds. Them the Harpy Podargé bore to Zephyrus, the wind, while feeding
in the meadows by the stream of Oceanus. And in the outer harness he
fastened illustrious Pedasus, whom Achilles led away long since, having
sacked the city of Eëtion; and which [steed], though being mortal,
accompanied immortal steeds. But Achilles, going about, armed all the
Myrmidons through the tents with their armour; but they, like
carnivorous wolves, in whose hearts is immense strength, and which,
having slain a great horned stag in the mountains, tearing, devour it;
but the jaws of all are red with blood: and then they rush in a pack,
lapping with slender tongues the surface of the dark water from a
black-water fountain, vomiting forth clots of blood; but the courage in
their breasts is dauntless, and their stomach is distended: so rushed
the leaders and chiefs of the Myrmidons round the brave attendant of
swift-footed Æacides, and amongst them stood warlike Achilles, animating
both the steeds and the shield-bearing warriors.</p>
<p>Fifty were the swift galleys which Achilles, dear to Jove, led to Troy;
and in each were fifty men, companions at the benches. But he had
appointed five leaders, in whom he put trust, to command them; and he
himself, being very powerful, governed. One troop indeed Menesthius,
with flexible corslet, commanded, the son of Sperchius, a Jove-descended
river; whom the daughter of Peleus, fair Polydora, bore to indefatigable
Sperchius, a woman having been embraced by a god; although, according to
report, to Borus, son of Perieres, who openly espoused her, giving
infinite marriage gifts. But warlike Eudorus commanded another
[company], clandestinely begotten, whom Polymela, the daughter of
Phylas, graceful in the dance, bore. Her the powerful slayer of
Argus<span id="footnotetag514"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-16.htm.html#footnote514" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">514</sup></a> loved, beholding her with his eyes among the dancers at a
choir of golden-bowed Diana, huntress-maid; and immediately ascending to
an upper chamber, pacific Mercury secretly lay with her: whence she
bore to him a son, Eudorus, swift to run, and also a warrior. But after
that birth-presiding Ilithyia had brought him into light, and he beheld
the splendour of the sun, the mighty strength of Echecleus, son of
Actor, led her to his house when he had given innumerable
marriage-gifts; whilst aged Phylas carefully nurtured and educated him,
tenderly loving him, as if being his own son. The third, warlike
Pisander led, the son of Mæmalus, who, after the companion of the son of
Peleus, surpassed all the Myrmidons in fighting with the spear. The
fourth, the aged knight Phœnix commanded; and Alcimedon, the illustrious
son of Laërceus, the fifth. But when Achilles, marshalling them well,
had placed all with their leaders, he enjoined this strict command:</p>
<p>“Ye Myrmidons, let none of you be forgetful of the threats with which,
at the swift ships, ye did threaten the Trojans, during all my
indignation, and blamed me, each of you [in this manner]: ‘O cruel son
of Peleus! surely thy mother nurtured thee in wrath: relentless! thou
who at the ships detainest thy companions against their will. Let us at
least return home again in our sea-traversing barks, since pernicious
wrath has thus fallen upon thy mind.’ These things ye frequently said to
me, when assembled; and now the great task of war appears, of which ye
were hitherto desirous. Let each one here, having a valiant heart, fight
against the Trojans.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote514"/><b>Footnote 514:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-16.htm.html#footnotetag514" class="pginternal">
(return) </a> Mercury.</p>
<p>Thus speaking, he aroused the might and spirit of each, and their ranks
were condensed the more when they heard the king. As when a man
constructs the wall of a lofty mansion with closely-joined stones,
guarding against the violence of the winds, so closely were their
helmets and bossed shields linked: then shield pressed upon shield,
helmet upon helmet, and man upon man; and the horse-hair crests upon the
shining cones of [their helmets] nodding, touched each other; so close
stood they to each other. Before all were armed two warriors. Patroclus
and Automedon, having one mind, to fight in the front of the Myrmidons.
But Achilles hastened to go into his tent; and he opened the lid of a
chest, beautiful, variously adorned, which silver-footed Thetis placed,
to be carried in his ship, having filled it well with garments, and
wind-resisting cloaks, and napped tapestry. And in it was a cup
curiously wrought, nor did any other of men drink dark wine from it,
nor did he pour out [from it] libations to any of the gods, except to
father Jove. This then, taking from the coffer, he first purified with
sulphur, and then washed in a crystal rivulet of water; but he himself
washed his hands, and drew off the dark wine. Next, standing in the
middle of the area, he prayed, and offered a libation of wine, looking
up to heaven; nor did he escape the notice of thunder-rejoicing Jove:</p>
<p>“O king Jove, Dodonean, Pelasgian, dwelling afar off, presiding over
wintry Dodona; but around dwell thy priests, the Selli, with unwashed
feet, and sleeping upon the ground; certainly thou didst formerly hear
my voice when praying: thou hast honoured me, and hast greatly injured
the people of the Greeks; wherefore now also accomplish this additional
request for me; for I myself will remain in the assemblage<span id="footnotetag515"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-16.htm.html#footnote515" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">515</sup></a> of
ships, but I am sending forth my companion with the numerous Myrmidons
to battle; along with him, do thou send forth glory, O far-sounding
Jove! embolden his heart within his breast, that even Hector may know
whether my attendant, even when alone, knows how to wage war, or [only]
when these invincible hands rage with him, when I likewise go forth to
the slaughter of Mars. But after he has repelled the contest and the
tumult from the ships, unscathed let him return to me, to the swift
barks, with all his armour and his close-fighting companions.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote515"/><b>Footnote 515:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-16.htm.html#footnotetag515" class="pginternal">

   it ἐν ναυστάθμῳ.</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, praying; and provident Jove heard him. One part indeed
the Sire granted him, but refused the other. He granted that he should
repel the conflict and tumult from the ships, but he refused that he
should return safe from the battle. He, on his part, having made a
libation and prayed to father Jove, again entered his tent, and replaced
the cup in the chest. Then coming out, he stood before the tent, for he
still wished in his mind to behold the grievous conflict of Trojans and
Greeks.</p>
<p>But those that were armed at the same time with magnanimous Patroclus,
marched orderly, till they rushed upon the Trojans, with high hopes.
Immediately they were poured out, like unto wasps dwelling by the
road-side, which silly boys are wont to irritate, incessantly harassing
them, possessing cells by the way-side; and cause a common evil to many.
And if by chance any traveller, passing by, unintentionally disturb
them, then they, possessing a valiant heart, all fly forth, and fight
for their young. The Myrmidons then, having the heart and courage of
these, poured out from the ships, and an inextinguishable tumult arose.
But Patroclus cheered on his companions, loudly shouting:</p>
<p>“Ye Myrmidons, companions of Achilles, the son of Peleus, be men, my
friends, and be mindful of impetuous valour; that we, his close-fighting
servants, may honour the son of Peleus, who is by far the bravest of the
Greeks at the ships; and that the son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon,
may know his fault, that he nothing honoured the bravest of the Greeks.”</p>
<p>Thus speaking, he aroused the might and spirits of each: and in dense
array they fell upon the Trojans: but the ships re-echoed dreadfully
around from the Greeks shouting. But the Trojans, when they beheld the
brave son of Menœtius, himself and his attendant glittering in arms, the
mind to all of them was disturbed, and the phalanxes were deranged,
deeming that the swift-footed son of Peleus at the ships had cast away
his wrath, and resumed friendship: then each one gazed about where he
might escape utter destruction.</p>
<p>But Patroclus first took aim with his shining spear from the opposite
side right into the midst, where they were huddled together in greatest
numbers at the stern of the ship of magnanimous Protesilaus, and wounded
Pyræchmes, who led the Pæonian equestrian warriors from Amydon, from the
wide-flowing Axius. Him he smote upon the right shoulder, and he fell on
his back in the dust groaning; but the Pæonians, his companions, were
put to flight around him, for Patroclus caused fear to them all, having
slain their leader, who was very brave to fight. And he drove them from
the ships, and extinguished the blazing fire. But the ship was left
there half-burnt, whilst the Trojans were routed with a prodigious
tumult: and the Greeks were poured forth amongst the hollow ships; and
mighty confusion was created. And as when, from the lofty summit of a
great mountain,<span id="footnotetag516"/>

respired for a little, having repelled the hostile fire from their
vessels. But of battle there was no cessation: for the Trojans were by
no means yet totally routed from the black ships by the warlike Greeks,
but still resisted, and retreated from the ships from necessity. Then of
the generals, man slew man, the fight being scattered; and first, the
brave son of Menœtius forthwith with his sharp spear smote the thigh of
Areïlochus when turned about, and drove the brass quite through: but the
spear broke the bone, and he fell prone upon the earth. But warlike
Menelaus then wounded Thoas in the breast, exposed near the shield, and
relaxed his limbs. But Phylides, perceiving Amphiclus rushing against
him, anticipated him, taking aim at the extremity of his leg, where the
calf of a man is thickest; the tendons were severed all round<span id="footnotetag518"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-16.htm.html#footnote518" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">518</sup></a> by
the point of the spear, and darkness overshadowed his eyes. Then the
sons of Nestor, the one, Antilochus, struck Atymnius with his sharp
spear, and drove the brazen lance through his flank; and he fell before
him: but Maris, standing before the carcase, rushed upon Antilochus hand
to hand with his spear, enraged on account of his brother; but godlike
Thrasymedes, taking aim, anticipated him before he had wounded
[Antilochus], nor did he miss him, [but wounded him] immediately near
the shoulder; and the point of the spear cut off the extremity of the
arm from the muscles, and completely tore away the bone. Falling, he
made a crash, and darkness veiled his eyes. Thus to Erebus went these
two, subdued by two brothers, the brave companions of Sarpedon, the

sad death a mortal man long since doomed to fate? Do so; but all we, the
other gods, will not assent to it. But another thing I will tell thee,
and do thou revolve it in thy mind. If indeed thou sendest this Sarpedon
safe home, reflect whether some other of the gods may not also wish to
send his beloved son [safe home] from the violent conflict; for many
sons of immortals fight round the great city of Priam, upon whom thou
wilt bring heavy wrath. If, however, he be dear to thee, and thy heart
pities him, let him indeed be subdued in the violent conflict, beneath
the hands of Patroclus, the son of Menœtius: but when his spirit and

<p>But when, advancing, they were now near each other, then indeed
Patroclus [struck] illustrious Thrasymelus, who was the brave companion
of king Sarpedon, him he struck upon the lower part of the belly, and
relaxed his limbs. Then Sarpedon, attacking second, missed him with his
splendid javelin; but he wounded his horse Pedasus, with his spear, in
the right shoulder; but he groaned, breathing out his life, and fell in
the dust, moaning, and his spirit fled from him. But the two [other
steeds] leaped asunder, and the yoke crashed, and the reins were
entangled about them, when the side horse lay in the dust. But
spear-renowned Automedon found an end of this. Drawing his long sword
from his robust thigh, rising, he cut away the farther horse, nor did he
act slothfully. And the two [remaining horses] were set aright, and were
directed by the reins; and they [the men] again engage in life-devouring

But the Myrmidons there held his panting steeds, eager to fly along,
since they had quitted the chariots of their lords. Then bitter grief
arose to Glaucus, hearing the voice [of his friend], and his heart was
grieved because he could not aid him. But grasping his own arm in his
hand, he compressed it; for grievously the wound pained him, which
Teucer, with an arrow, had inflicted upon him, as he was rushing against
the lofty wall, warding off the battle from his companions. Wherefore,
praying, he addressed far-darting Apollo:</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote535"/><b>Footnote 535:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-16.htm.html#footnotetag535" class="pginternal">

<p>“Hear, O king, thou who art somewhere in the rich state of Lycia, or in
Troy; for thou canst everywhere hear a man afflicted, as sorrow now
comes upon me. For indeed I have this grievous wound, and my hand is
penetrated on every side with acute pains, nor can the blood be
stanched, but my shoulder is oppressed with it. For neither can I firmly
I hold my spear, nor, advancing, fight with the enemy; moreover a very
brave hero has fallen, Sarpedon, the son of Jove; but he aids not even
his own son. But heal for me this severe wound, O king; assuage my
pains, and grant me strength, that, cheering on my companions, the
Lycians, I may urge them to fight; and may myself fight for the dead
body.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke praying; but Phœbus Apollo heard him. Immediately he
allayed the pains, and dried the black gore from the grievous wound, and
instilled strength into his soul. But Glaucus knew in his mind, and
rejoiced because the mighty god had quickly heard him praying. First
then, going about in all directions, he aroused the heroes, leaders of
the Lycians, to fight for Sarpedon; and then he went to the Trojans,
advancing with long strides to Polydamas, son of Panthous, and noble
Agenor. He also went after Æneas and brazen-armed Hector, and, standing
near, addressed to him winged words:</p>
<p>“O Hector, now hast thou altogether neglected thine allies, who are
losing their lives for thy sake, far away from their friends and
father-land; but thou dost not wish to aid them. Sarpedon lies low, the
leader of the shield-bearing Lycians, who protected Lycia by his justice
and his valour. Him hath brazen Mars subdued with a spear at the hands
of Patroclus. But stand near, my friends, and be indignant in your
minds, lest the Myrmidons spoil his armour, and unworthily treat the
body, enraged on account of the Greeks, as many as have perished, whom
we have slain with our spears at the ships.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but intolerable, unyielding grief wholly possessed the
Trojans, for he had been a pillar of their city, though being a
foreigner; for many forces followed along with him, among whom he
himself was the most valiant in battle. They therefore advanced eagerly
straight against the Greeks, ardent with desire; but Hector led the way,
enraged on account of Sarpedon. But the valiant heart of Patroclus, son
of Menœtius, aroused the Greeks. First he addressed the Ajaces, though
they themselves were also eager:</p>
<p>“O Ajaces, now let it be a delightful thing to you both to repel [the
foe]; be ye such as of old ye were amongst heroes, or even braver.

<p>Thus he spoke; but they also themselves were ready to repel [the foe].
But when they had strengthened their phalanxes on both sides, the
Trojans and Lycians, as well as the Myrmidons and Achæans, they closed
to fight round the dead body, shouting dreadfully, and loudly rattled
the arms of men. But Jove stretched pernicious night over the violent
contest, that there might be a destructive toil of battle around his
dear son. The Trojans first drove back the rolling-eyed Greeks; for a
man was smitten, by no means the most inferior among the Myrmidons,
noble Epigeus, son of magnanimous Agacles, who formerly ruled in
well-inhabited Budium; but then having slain a noble kinsman, he came as
a suppliant to Peleus and silver-footed Thetis: they sent him to follow
with the rank-breaker Achilles, to steed-renowned Ilium, that he might
fight with the Trojans. Him then, while seizing the body, illustrious
Hector struck upon the head with a stone; and it was entirely split in
two in his strong helmet; and he fell prone upon the corpse, and
soul-destroying death was diffused around him. Then to Patroclus grief
arose, on account of his companion slain; and he rushed right through
the foremost warriors, like unto a swift hawk, which has put to flight
jackdaws or starlings; so, O equestrian Patroclus, didst thou rush right
against the Lycians and Trojans; for thou wert enraged in thine heart
for thy companion. And he struck Sthenelaus, the beloved son of
Ithæmeneus, on the neck with a stone, and broke his tendons: and the
foremost warriors and illustrious Hector gave back. And as far as is
the cast of a long javelin, which a man may have sent forth striving
either in the game, or even in war, on account of life-destroying
enemies; so far did the Trojans retire, and the Greeks repelled them.
But Glaucus, the leader of the shield-bearing Lycians, first turned, and
slew magnanimous Bathycles, the beloved son of Chalcon, who, inhabiting
dwellings in Hellas, was conspicuous among the Myrmidons for his riches
and wealth. Him then Glaucus, turning suddenly round, wounded in the
middle of the breast with his spear, when, pursuing, he had overtaken
him. But he made a crash as he fell; and deep grief possessed the
Greeks, because a brave warrior had thus fallen; but the Trojans greatly
rejoiced, and, advancing in crowds, stood round him; nor were the Greeks
forgetful of valour, but they directed their strength straight against
them. Then again Meriones slew a hero of the Trojans, the warrior
Laogonus, the gallant son of Onetor, who was the priest of Idæan Jove,
and was honoured like a god by the people. He smote him under the jaw
and ear, and his soul immediately departed from his limbs, and dreadful
darkness overshadowed him.<span id="footnotetag537"/>

Meriones, for he hoped to hit him, advancing under protection of his

rapid weapon spent its force. Thus the javelin of Æneas, quivering
entered the earth, for it had fled in vain from his strong hand. Then
Æneas was enraged in his mind, and said:</p>

<p>But him then in turn spear-renowned Meriones answered: “Æneas, it were
difficult for thee, although being brave, to extinguish the valour of
all men, whosoever may come against thee about to repulse thee; for thou
too art mortal. And if I, taking aim, should strike thee in the middle
with my sharp spear, although being brave, and confiding in thy might,
thou wouldst give glory to me, but thy soul to steed-famed Pluto.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but him the brave son of Menœtius rebuked: “Meriones, why
dost thou, although being brave, harangue thus? O, my friend, the
Trojans will not retire from the corse by opprobrious words: first will
the earth possess some of them; for the emergency of battle is placed in
the hands, but of counsel in words; wherefore it is by no means
necessary to multiply words, but to fight.”</p>
<p>So saying, he on his part led the way, and along with him the godlike
hero followed. And as the crash of woodcutting men arises in the dells
of a mountain, and the sound is heard from afar; so the noise of these,
smitten with swords and two-edged spears, arose from the wide-extended
plain, from brass, from leather, and from well-prepared bull’s-hide
shields. Nor would a man, although very discerning, have recognized
noble Sarpedon, since he was totally involved, from his head to the
soles of his feet, with weapons, and blood, and dust. But they still
crowded round the corse, as when flies in the stall hum around the pails
full of milk, during the spring season, when the milk makes moist the
vessel. So they still crowded round the body: nor did Jove ever turn his
bright eyes from the violent conflict; but he ever beheld them, and
meditated many evil things in his mind concerning the death of
Patroclus, anxiously deliberating whether now illustrious Hector should
kill him with his spear in the brave battle, over godlike Sarpedon, and
spoil the armour from his shoulders, or whether he should still increase
the severe labour to the multitude. To him, thus reflecting, it appeared
better that the brave servant of Achilles, the son of Peleus, should
repulse the Trojans and brazen-armed Hector, towards the city, and take
away the life of many. Into Hector, therefore, first [of all], he sent
unwarlike flight, and ascending his chariot, he turned himself to
flight, and advised the other Trojans to fly, for he recognized the
sacred scales of Jove.<span id="footnotetag540"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-16.htm.html#footnote540" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">540</sup></a> Then not even the brave Lycians remained,
but were all turned in flight, when they beheld their king wounded to
the heart, lying in the heap of dead; for many had fallen over him,
whilst the son of Saturn stretched on the violent strife. But after they
had taken from the shoulders of Sarpedon the brazen and glittering
armour, the gallant son of Menœtius gave them to his companions to carry
to the hollow ships; and then cloud-compelling Jove addressed Apollo:</p>
<p>“Come now, dear Phœbus, going, cleanse Sarpedon, [withdrawn] from among
the heap of weapons, of sable gore, and afterwards bearing him far away,
lave him in the stream of the river, and anoint him with ambrosia, and
put around him immortal garments, then give him in charge to the
twin-brothers. Sleep and Death, swift conductors, to be borne away, who
will quickly place him in the rich state of wide Lycia. There will his
brethren and kindred perform his obsequies with a tomb and a

<p>Thus he spoke; nor was Apollo inattentive to his father, but he
descended from the Idæan mountains to the grievous conflict. Immediately
removing noble Sarpedon out of [the reach of] weapons, and bearing him
far away, he laved him in the stream of the river, anointed him with
ambrosia, and placed around him immortal garments, then gave him in
charge to the twin-brothers, Sleep and Death, swift conductors, to be
borne away with them; who accordingly quickly placed him in the rich
state of wide Lycia.</p>
<p>In the meantime Patroclus, cheering on his steeds, and Automedon,
followed upon the Trojans and Lycians, and came to great
harm,—infatuate one!—but if he had observed the direction of the son
of Peleus, he had certainly escaped the evil fate of black death. But
the counsel of Jove is ever better than that of men, who puts to flight
even the valiant man, and easily deprives him of victory, even when he
himself has impelled him to fight; who then also excited courage in his
breast. Then whom first, and whom last, didst thou slay, O Patroclus,
when the gods now called thee on to death? Adrastus indeed first,
Autonous and Echeclus, and Perimus, son of Megas, and Epistor and
Melanippus; but then Elasus, and Mulius, and Pylartes. These he slew,
but the others were, each of them, mindful of flight. Then indeed had
the sons of the Greeks taken lofty-gated Troy, by the hands of
Patroclus, for he raged greatly beyond [others] with his spear, had not
Phœbus Apollo stood upon a well-built tower, meditating destructive
things to him, and assisting the Trojans. Thrice indeed Patroclus
mounted a buttress of the lofty wall, and thrice did Apollo repel him
with violence, striking his glittering shield with his immortal hands.
But when now, godlike, he rushed on the fourth time, far-casting
Apollo, threatening fearfully, addressed him:</p>
<p>“Retire, thou Jove-sprung Patroclus; by no means is it destined that the
city of the magnanimous Trojans should be destroyed by thy spear, nor by
Achilles, who is much better than thou.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, but Patroclus retired far back, avoiding the wrath of
far-darting Apollo. But Hector detained his steeds at the Scæan<span id="footnotetag542"/>

gates; for he doubted whether, having driven again into the crowd, he
should fight, or should loudly command the people to be collected within
the walls. To him then, meditating these things, Phœbus Apollo stood
near, having assimilated himself to a hero youthful and brave, to Asius,
who was the maternal uncle of horse-breaking Hector, own brother of
Hecuba, and the son of Dymas, who dwelt in Phrygia, by the streams of
the Sangarius: to him Phœbus Apollo, assimilating himself, spoke:</p>

<p>“Hector, why dost thou cease from battle? Nor does it at all become
thee. Would that I were so much superior to thee as I am inferior; then
indeed wouldst thou quickly have retired from the battle to thy loss.
But come, direct thy solid-hoofed steeds against Patroclus, if perchance
thou mayest slay him, and Apollo may give thee glory.” So saying, the
god on his part went again through the labour of men; but illustrious
Hector on his part commanded warlike Cebriones to lash on his steeds to
the battle, whilst Apollo, proceeding, entered the throng; and sent an
evil tumult among the Greeks; but gave glory to the Trojans and Hector.
Then indeed did Hector neglect the other Greeks, nor slew them; but
directed his solid-hoofed horses against Patroclus. But Patroclus, on
the other side, leaped from his chariot to the ground, in his left hand
holding his spear; but in the other he seized a stone, white, rugged,
which his hand embraced around. Putting his force to it, he hurled it;
nor did it err far from the man, nor was the weapon hurled in
vain,<span id="footnotetag543"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-16.htm.html#footnote543" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">543</sup></a> for in the forehead with the sharp stone he smote the
charioteer of Hector, Cebriones, the illegitimate son of illustrious
Priam, whilst holding the reins of the horses. But the stone crushed
both his eyebrows, nor did the bone sustain it, and his eyes fell amid
the dust upon the ground before his feet. But he then, like unto a
diver, fell from the well-formed chariot-seat, and life left his bones.
But him insulting, thou didst address, O equestrian Patroclus:</p>

<p>“O gods! truly he is a very active man! how nimbly he dives! if indeed
he were anywhere in the fishy sea, this man, groping for oysters, might
have satisfied many, plunging from his ship, although it might be
stormy; so easily now in the plain does he dive from his chariot!
Without doubt there are divers among the Trojans.”</p>
<p>So saying, he advanced against the hero Cebriones, having the force of a
lion, which, ravaging the folds, is wounded in the breast, and his own
courage destroys him; thus, O Patroclus, ardent, didst thou spring upon
Cebriones; whilst Hector, on the other side, leaped from his chariot to
the ground. These two, as lions, fought for Cebriones, when both being
hungry fight with utmost courage for a slaughtered stag in mountain
tops. So, for Cebriones, these two masters of the fight, Patroclus, son
of Menœtius, and illustrious Hector, wished to rend each other’s body
with the pitiless brass. Hector indeed, after he seized him by the head,
did not let him go; but Patroclus, on the other side, held [him by the]
foot; and now the rest of the Trojans and Greeks engaged in the violent
conflict.</p>
<p>And as the East and South winds strive with each other, in the dells of
a mountain, to shake a deep wood, beech, ash, and rugged cornel, but
they strike their long-extended boughs against each other with an
immense sound, and a crash of them breaking [arises]; thus the Trojans
and Greeks, leaping upon each other, slaughtered, but neither were
mindful of pernicious flight. And many sharp spears were fixed round
Cebriones, and winged arrows bounding from the string; and many huge
stones smote the shields of those fighting round him; but he, mighty
over mighty space, lay in a whirlwind of dust, forgetful of his
equestrian skill.</p>
<p>As long indeed as the sun was ascending the middle heaven, so long did
the weapons reach both sides effectually, and the people kept falling.
But when the sun had passed over towards the west, then indeed the
Greeks were superior, contrary to fate. They drew the hero Cebriones
from the weapons, out of the tumult of Trojans, and took the armour from
his shoulders. But Patroclus, devising evils against the Trojans, rushed
on. Thrice then he charged, equal to swift Mars, shouting horridly, and
thrice he slew nine heroes. But when, like unto a god, he made the
attack for the fourth time, then indeed, O Patroclus, was the end of thy
life manifest; for Phœbus, terrible in the dire battle, met thee. He did
not indeed perceive him coming through the crowd, for he advanced
against him covered with much darkness; but he stood behind, and smote
him with his flat hand upon the back and broad shoulders, and his eyes
were seized with giddiness.<span id="footnotetag544"/>

the helmet, and the oblong helmet rattled, rolling under the horses’
feet, and the crest was defiled with blood and dust; although before
this it was not permitted that [this] helmet, crested with horse-hair,
should be contaminated by the dust; for it protected the head of a
godlike hero, even the venerable forehead of Achilles; but Jove then
gave it to Hector to wear upon his head; but his destruction was near.
But the long-shadowed spear, great, sturdy, pointed [with brass], was
utterly shattered in his hands; whilst the shield, which reached to his
heels, with its belt, fell to the ground; and king Apollo, the son of
Jove, unbound his corslet. But stupor seized his brain, and his fair
limbs were relaxed under him, and he stood astounded. But a Trojan,
hero, Euphorbus, the son of Panthous, who excelled those of his own age
in the spear, in horsemanship, and in swiftness of foot, smote him close
at hand with his sharp spear, in the back between the shoulders. For
even before this he had hurled twenty men from their horses, at first
coming with his chariot, learning [the art] of war. He [it was] who
first hurled a weapon at thee, O knight Patroclus, nor did he subdue
thee; for he ran back, and was mingled with the crowd, having plucked
the ashen spear out of thy body; nor did he await Patroclus, though
being unarmed, in the fight. Patroclus, however, subdued by the blow of
the god, and by the spear, retired into the crowd of his companions,
avoiding death. But Hector, when he perceived magnanimous Patroclus
retiring, wounded with a sharp spear, went through the ranks near him,
and smote him with his javelin in the lowest part of the groin, and
drove the brass quite through. Falling, he gave a crash, and greatly
grieved the people of the Greeks. As when a lion presses on an unwearied
boar in fight, and they twain, high spirited, contend upon the mountain
tops for a small rill, for they both desire to drink, but the lion
subdues him by force, panting much; so Hector, the son of Priam, in
close fight with his spear, deprived the gallant son of Menœtius of
life, having slain many; and, boasting over him, spoke winged words:</p>
