<h2>BOOK THE EIGHTEENTH.</h2>
<h4 id="pgepubid00042">ARGUMENT.</h4>
<p>Thetis comforts her son for the death of Patroclus, and promises to
procure him new armour from Vulcan. At the command of Juno, Achilles
comes forth and strikes terror into the enemy. The body of Patroclus is
rescued, and prepared for funeral rites, and Vulcan forges a suit of
armour and a splendid shield for Achilles.</p>

swift-footed Antilochus came as a messenger to Achilles. Him he found in
front of his lofty-prowed ships, revolving in his mind those things
which had already been accomplished; and then groaning, he communed with
his own mind:</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote569"/><b>Footnote 569:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-18.htm.html#footnotetag569" class="pginternal">
(return) </a> This is to be taken in connection with ver. 148 of
   the last book, as the regular narrative is interrupted by the
   message of Antilochus and the grief of Achilles.</p>
<p>“Ah me! why are the long-haired Achæans driven back in confusion to the
ships, routed through the plain? [I fear] lest the gods have
accomplished evil sorrows to my soul, as my mother once informed me, and
told me that the bravest of the Myrmidons, I being yet alive, would
leave the light of the sun, by the hands of the Trojans. Too surely now
the valiant son of Menœtius is dead,—obstinate one! certainly I
desired him, having repelled the hostile fire, to return to the ships,
nor to fight bravely with Hector.”</p>
<p>Whilst he was revolving these things in his mind and in his soul, in the
meantime the son of illustrious Nestor drew near, shedding warm tears,
and delivered his sad message:</p>
<p>“Alas! O son of warlike Peleus, surely thou wilt hear a very grievous
message, which—would that it had not taken place. Patroclus lies low;
and around his unarmed corse they are now fighting, whilst crest-tossing
Hector possesses his armour.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but him a black cloud of grief overshadowed, and taking
the burnt ashes with both hands, he poured them on his head, and denied
his comely countenance; but the dark ashes everywhere adhered to his
rich<span id="footnotetag570"/>

dust, and tearing, he disordered his hair with his hands. The handmaids,
whom Achilles and Patroclus had taken, grieved in their souls, shrieked
aloud, and ran out of the door round warlike Achilles; and all smote
their breasts with their hands,<span id="footnotetag571"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-18.htm.html#footnote571" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">571</sup></a> and the limbs of each were relaxed.
Antilochus, on the other side, lamented, shedding tears, holding the
hands of Achilles; (and he kept groaning within his generous heart,) for
he feared lest he should cut his throat with his sword. Then he moaned
dreadfully, and his venerable mother heard him, sitting in the depths of
the sea, beside her aged father, and immediately lamented: and all the
goddesses assembled around her, as many Nereïdes as were at the bottom
of the sea. There were Glauce, Thaleia, and Cymodoce, Nesæa, Spio, Thoa,
and large-eyed Halia, Cymothoë, Actæa, and Limnorea, Melita, Iæra,
Amphithoë, and Agave, Doto, Proto, Pherusa, and Dynamene, Dexamene,
Amphinome, and Callianira, Doris, Panope, and distinguished Galatea,
Nemertes, Apseudes, and Callianassa. There were also Clymene, Ianira,
and Ianassa, Mæra, Orithya, and fair-haired Amathea, and other Nereïdes
which were in the depths of the sea. But the resplendent cave was full
of them, and all at once they beat their breasts; but Thetis began the
lamentation:</p>

are in my mind. Woe is me wretched! woe is me who have in an evil hour

weeping, and the wave of the ocean was cleft around for them.<span id="footnotetag574"/>

winged words:</p>

<p>“O son, why weepest thou, and what sorrow has come upon thy mind? Speak
out, nor conceal it. Those things indeed are fulfilled for thee from
Jove, as thou didst formerly pray, lifting up thy hands—that all the
sons of the Greeks, wanting thee, should, be collected at the ships, and
suffer disgraceful deeds.”</p>
<p>But her swift-footed Achilles addressed, deeply groaning:</p>
<p>“Mother mine, these things indeed the Olympian king hath accomplished
for me; but what pleasure is there in them to me, since Patroclus, my
dear companion, is dead, whom I honoured beyond all my companions,
equally with my own head? Him have I lost; and Hector, having slain him,
has stripped off his mighty armour, a wonder to be seen, beautiful;
which the other gods gave to Peleus, splendid gifts, on that day when
they laid thee in the bed of a mortal man. Would that thou hadst dwelt
there among the immortal marine inhabitants, and that Peleus had wedded
a mortal spouse. But now [thou hast been wedded, to the end] that
immeasurable grief may be upon thy mind for thy son slain, whom thou
shalt not again receive, having returned home. Since even my mind urges
me not to live nor have intercourse with men, unless Hector first lose
his life, smitten by my spear, and pay the penalty for the
slaughter<span id="footnotetag575"/>

<p>But him Thetis in turn addressed, pouring forth tears: “Short-lived thou
wilt be, O my son, as thou sayest, for fate is ready for thee
immediately after Hector.” Then, heavily sighing, swift-footed Achilles
addressed her: “May I die then immediately, since it was not destined
that I should aid my companion now slain; but he indeed hath perished
far away from his native land, and longed for me to be an averter of his
doom. But now<span id="footnotetag576"/>

who have been subdued in great numbers by noble Hector; but sit beside
the ships, an useless weight on the earth, being such as is none of the
brazen-mailed Achæans in war, though in council there are others
superior; would that therefore contention might be extinguished from
gods and men; and anger, which is wont to impel even the very wisest to
be harsh; and which, much sweeter than distilling honey, like smoke,
rises in the breasts of men; so now did Agamemnon, king of men, enrage
me: but although greatly grieved, let us leave these things to pass by
as done, subduing, from necessity, our own spirit within our bosoms: but
now will I go, that I may find Hector, the destroyer of my dear friend,
and I will accept death whensoever Jove and the other immortal gods
shall please to accomplish it. For not even the might of Hercules
escaped death, who was very dear to king Jove, the son of Saturn; but
fate subdued him, and the grievous wrath of Juno. So also shall I lie,
when I am dead, if a similar fate be destined for me; but now may I bear
away illustrious glory, and compel some one of the Trojan women and
deep-robed Dardanians to sigh frequently, wiping away the tears from her
tender cheeks with both hands; and may they know that I have long ceased
from battle.<span id="footnotetag578"/>

<p>Him then the silver-footed goddess Thetis answered: “Certainly this is
true, O son, nor is it an evil thing to avert utter destruction from our
friends when afflicted. But thy beautiful arms, brazen and shining, are
detained among the Trojans, which crest-tossing Hector himself, having
on his shoulders, boasts of: yet I suspect that he will not long glory
in them, for death is near to him. But do thou by no means enter the
slaughter of Mars before thou beholdest me with thine eyes coming
hither. For at dawn I will return with the rising sun, bearing beautiful
armour from king Vulcan.”</p>
<p>Thus having spoken, she turned round from her son, and being turned,
addressed her marine sisters: “Enter ye now the broad bosom of the deep,
about to behold the marine old man, and the mansions of my sire, and
tell him all things; but I go to lofty Olympus, to Vulcan, the skilful
artist, to try if he is willing to give my son illustrious, glittering
armour.”</p>
<p>Thus she spoke, but they immediately sank beneath the wave of the sea.
But Thetis, the silver-footed goddess, again departed to Olympus, that
she might bear the illustrious armour to her beloved son. Her, on the
one hand, her feet bore towards Olympus: but the Greeks, flying with a
heaven-sent uproar from man-slaughtering Hector, reached the ships and
the Hellespont. Nor had the well-greaved Greeks drawn off the dead body
of Patroclus, the attendant of Achilles, out of the reach of weapons;
for now again both infantry and cavalry pursued him, and Hector, the son
of Priam, like unto a flame in violence. Thrice did illustrious Hector
seize him behind by the feet, eager to draw him away, and loudly shouted
to the Trojans; and thrice did the two Ajaces, clad in impetuous might,
forcibly repulse him from the corse; whilst he, with steady purpose,
ever relying on his might, sometimes charged through the crowd, and
sometimes again stopped, loudly shouting; but never retreated
altogether. But as night-watching<span id="footnotetag579"/>

drive away from a carcase a tawny lion, greatly hungering; so were the
two warriors, the Ajaces, unable to drive away Hector, the son of
Priam, from the body. And now indeed would he have dragged it off, and
obtained great glory, had not fleet wind-footed Iris come as a messenger
to the son of Peleus, running down from Olympus, that he should arm
himself unknown to Jove and the other gods; for Juno sent her forth; and
standing near, she addressed to him winged words:</p>

<p>Thus indeed having spoken, swift-footed Iris departed; but Achilles,
dear to Jove, arose; and around his strong shoulders Minerva threw her
fringed ægis. And the divine one of goddesses crowned his head around
with a golden cloud, and from it she kindled a shining flame. And as
when smoke, ascending from a city, reaches the æther from an island afar
off, which foes invest, who [pouring out] from their city, contend all
day in hateful fight: but with the setting sun torches blaze one after
another,<span id="footnotetag584"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-18.htm.html#footnote584" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">584</sup></a> and the splendour arises, rushing upwards, for [their]
neighbours to behold, if perchance they may come with ships, as
repellers of the war; thus did the flame from the head of Achilles reach
the sky. He stood, having advanced from the wall to the trench, nor
mingled with the Greeks, for he reverenced the prudent advice of his
mother. There standing, he shouted, and Pallas Minerva, on the other
side, vociferated, and stirred up immense tumult among the Trojans. And
as the tone is very clear, when a trumpet sounds, while deadly foes are
investing a city; so distinct then was the voice of the descendant of
Æacus. But when they heard the brazen voice of Achilles, the soul was
disturbed to all, whilst the beautiful-maned steeds turned the chariots
backwards, for they presaged sorrows in their mind. The charioteers were
panic-struck when they beheld the terrific, indefatigable flame, blazing
over the head of magnanimous Pelides; for the azure-eyed goddess Minerva
lighted it. Thrice over the trench loudly shouted noble Achilles, and
thrice were the Trojans and their illustrious allies thrown into
confusion. There then perished twelve bravest heroes by their chariots
and spears, whilst the Greeks, dragging Patroclus with joy out of the
reach of weapons, stretched him on a bier; but his beloved companions
stood round him mourning, and with them followed swift-footed Achilles,
shedding warm tears, when he beheld his faithful comrade lying upon a
bier, lacerated with the sharp brass: whom indeed he had sent forth with
his horses and chariots to battle, but did not receive him again, having
returned.</p>

<p>But the large-eyed, venerable Juno sent the unwearied sun, to return to
the flowing of the ocean, against his inclination. The sun then set, and
the noble Greeks desisted from the violent conflict, and the equally
destructive battle. The Trojans again, on the other side, retiring from
the violent combat, loosed their fleet steeds from their chariots. But
they assembled in the council before they bethought them of their
banquet. The assembly consisted of persons standing up, nor did any one
dare to sit; for fear possessed all, because Achilles had appeared, who
had long abstained from the direful combat. Among them prudent
Polydamas, the son of Panthus, began to speak, for he alone saw both the
future and the past. He was the companion of Hector, and they were born
in one night, but the one excelled in counsel, and the other greatly in
the spear. He wisely counselling, harangued them, and spoke:</p>
<p>“My friends, consider well on both sides; for I advise that we now
return to the city, nor await the sacred Morn in the plain near the
ships; for we are far away from the wall. As long indeed as this man was
wroth with noble Agamemnon, so long were the Greeks more easy to fight
with. For even I was delighted, passing the night by the swift barks,
expecting that we should take the equally-plied barks; but now greatly
do I fear swift-footed Pelides: so violent is his soul, nor will he be
content to remain in the plain, where usually the Trojans and Greeks in
the intervening space divide<span id="footnotetag585"/>

for the city and our wives. We will go, then, towards the city—be
persuaded by me—for so it must be. Ambrosial night at present hath made
swift-footed Pelides cease; but if, rushing forth to-morrow with his
arms, he shall find us here, then will some one know him; for gladly
will he reach sacred Ilium, whosoever shall escape: but dogs and
vultures will devour many of the Trojans. O that such [tidings] may be

<p>Him, then, crest-tossing Hector sternly regarding, addressed:</p>
<p>“No longer, O Polydamas, dost thou speak these things agreeable to me,
thou who advisest us, returning, to be cooped up in the city. Are ye not
yet satiated with being shut up within the towers? Formerly indeed all
articulate-speaking men pronounced the city of Priam rich in gold and in
brass; but now have the rich treasures of our houses perished, and many
possessions have already departed to Phrygia and agreeable Mœonia, to be
sold, since mighty Jove was enraged. But at this crisis, when the son of
politic Saturn has granted me to obtain glory at the ships, and to hem
in the Greeks by the sea, no longer, foolish man, disclose these
counsels to the people: for none of the Trojans will obey; nor will I
permit them. But come, let us all obey as I shall advise. At present
take supper in your ranks throughout the army; be mindful of the watch,
and keep guard each [of you]; but whosoever of the Trojans is
particularly anxious about his possessions, collecting them together,
let him give them to the people to be publicly consumed; it is better
that any of them should enjoy them than the Greeks. But to-morrow, with
the dawn, arrayed in armour, let us excite sharp conflict at the hollow
ships, and if truly noble Achilles has arisen at the ships, it will be
the worse for him, if he wishes [to fight]: I indeed will not fly him
from the horrid-sounding battle, but will stand very obstinately against
him, whether he bear away great glory, or I bear it away. Mars [is]

<p>Thus Hector harangued, and the Trojans shouted in applause: foolish men,
for Pallas Minerva had taken their senses away from them. For they
assented to Hector, advising destructive things, whilst no one
[assented to] Polydamas, who advised prudent counsel. Then they took
supper through the army. But the Greeks, lamenting all night, wept over
Patroclus, but among them Pelides led the ceaseless lamentation, placing
his man-slaying hands upon the breast of his companion, very frequently
sighing; as the well-bearded lion, from whom the stag-hunter has stolen
the cubs out of the thick forest; and he is grieved, coming afterwards.
And through many valleys he goes, tracking the footsteps of the man, if
anywhere he may find him; for very keen rage possesses him. So, deeply
sighing, he addressed the Myrmidons:</p>
<p>“Alas! vain indeed was the promise I uttered on that day, encouraging
the hero Menœtius in our halls; for I said that I would bring back his
illustrious son to Opus, having wasted Troy, and obtained a share of the
spoil. But Jove fulfils not for men all their intentions; for it is
fated that we shall both stain with blood the same earth here in Troy;
but neither shall aged horse-driving Peleus receive me in his palaces,
returning, nor my mother Thetis, but the earth shall here hold me. Now,
however, O Patroclus! since after thee I go beneath the earth, I shall
not perform thy funeral rites, before that I bring hither the arms and
head of magnanimous Hector, thy murderer, and behead twelve illustrious
sons of the Trojans, before thy pile, enraged on account of thee slain.
Meanwhile thou shall lie thus at the crooked ships; and round thee
Trojan [dames] and deep-bosomed Dardanians shall weep and shed tears
night and day; whom we ourselves have toiled to get by our valour and
the long spear, laying waste the rich cities of articulate-speaking
men.”</p>
<p>Thus having spoken, noble Achilles ordered his companions to surround a
large tripod with fire, that as soon as possible they might wash away
the bloody gore from Patroclus. They then placed a bathing tripod on the
blazing fire, and poured water into it, and taking fagots, lighted them
under it. The fire indeed encircled the belly of the tripod, and the
water was warmed. But when the water boiled in the sonorous brass, then
they both washed him, and anointed him with rich oil. And they filled up
his wounds with ointment nine years old; and laying him upon a bed, they
covered him with fine linen from head to foot; and over all, with a
white mantle.<span id="footnotetag589"/>

wept around swift-footed Achilles. But Jove addressed Juno, his sister
and wife:</p>
<p>“And at length thou hast accomplished thy object, O large-eyed,
venerable Juno, having aroused swift-fooled Achilles. Surely the
waving-crested Greeks are born from thy very self.”</p>

<p>But him large-eyed, venerable Juno then answered:</p>
<p>“Most imperious son of Saturn, what a word hast thou spoken? Surely now
any man who is mortal, and knows not so many designs, might accomplish
this against a man. How therefore ought not I, who boast myself to be
chief of the goddesses, both from birth and also because I am called thy
wife (and thou rulest over all the immortals), being enraged with the
Trojans, to [be able to] design evils against them.”</p>
<p>Thus indeed they conversed with one another. But silver-footed Thetis
reached the abode of Vulcan, incorruptible, starry, remarkable amongst
the immortals, brazen, which the lame-footed himself had constructed.
Him she found sweating, exerting himself at the bellows, earnestly
working; for he was making full twenty tripods to stand around the wall
of his well-built palace. Under the base of each he placed golden
wheels, that of their own accord they might enter the heavenly council,
and again return home—a wonder to be seen. So much finish had they, but
he had not yet added the well-made handles, which he was preparing; and
he was forging the rivets. Whilst he was toiling at these things with,
skilful mind, meanwhile Thetis, the silver-footed goddess, came to him.
But the beautiful and fair-veiled Charis, whom illustrious Vulcan had
espoused, advancing, beheld her; and hung upon her hand, and addressed
her, and spoke:</p>
<p>“Why, O long-robed Thetis, venerable, beloved, dost thou visit our
abode? Formerly thou wast not in the habit of coming frequently.<span id="footnotetag590"/>

But follow farther onwards, that I may set before thee hospitable fare.”</p>
<p>Thus having spoken, the divine of goddesses led on. Then indeed she
placed her upon a silver-studded throne, beautiful, variously wrought,
and there was a stool under her feet. But she called Vulcan, the
distinguished artist, and spoke this word:</p>
<p>“Come hither, Vulcan, Thetis now has need of thee.”</p>
<p>But her illustrious Vulcan then answered: “Assuredly then an awful and
revered goddess is within, who saved me when distress came upon me,
fallen down far by the contrivance of my shameless mother, who wished to
conceal me, being lame.<span id="footnotetag591"/>

<p>Him then Thetis, pouring forth tears, answered: “O Vulcan, has any then,
as many as are the goddesses in Olympus, endured so many bitter griefs
in her mind, as, to me above all, Jove, the son of Saturn, has given
sorrows? Me, from among the other marine inhabitants, has he subjected
to a man, to Peleus, son of Æacus; and I have endured the couch of a man
very much against my will. He, indeed, now lies in his palaces,
afflicted with grievous old age; but now other [woes] are my lot. After
he had granted me to bring forth aud nurture a son, distinguished among
heroes, and who grew up like a plant; him having reared, as a plant in a
fertile spot of the field, I sent forth in the crooked barks to Ilium,
to fight with the Trojans; but him I shall not receive again, having
returned home to the mansion of Peleus. As long, however, as he lives to
me, and beholds the light of the sun, he suffers sorrow, nor am I, going
to him, able to avail him aught. The maid whom the sons of the Greeks
selected as a reward for him, her hath king Agamemnon taken back again
from his hands. Certainly, grieving for her, he has been wasting his
soul; whilst the Trojans were hemming in the Greeks at the ships, nor
suffered them to go beyond the gates: but the elders of the Greeks
supplicated him, and named many distinguished presents. But then he
refused to avert destruction, yet he clad Patroclus in his own armour,
and sent him forth to the battle, and he gave with him much people. All
day they fought round the Scæan gates, and certainly on that day had
overturned Troy, had not Apollo slain, among the foremost warriors, the
gallant son of Menœtius, after having done much mischief, and given
glory to Hector. On this account do I now approach thy knees, if thou
wilt give to my short-lived son a shield and helmet, and beautiful
greaves, joined with clasps, and a corslet: for what were his, his
faithful companion has lost, subdued by the Trojans; and he (Achilles)
lies upon the ground, grieving in his soul.”</p>
<p>Her then illustrious Vulcan answered: “Take courage, nor let these
things be cause of uneasiness in thy mind; for would that I could so
surely conceal him from dread-sounding death, when grievous fate
approaches him, as that beautiful armour shall be ready for him, such as
any one of many men shall hereafter admire, whosoever may behold it.”</p>
<p>So saying, he left her there, and went towards the bellows, which he
turned towards the fire, and commanded them to work. And full twenty
bellows blew in the furnaces, exciting a varied well-regulated<span id="footnotetag595"/>

Vulcan pleased, and that the work might be complete. He cast into the

to divide all things into two parts,—the wealth, whatever the pleasant
city contained within it. They, however, had not yet complied, but were
secretly arming themselves for an ambuscade. Meanwhile, their beloved
wives and young children kept watch, standing above, and amongst them
the men whom old age possessed. But they (the younger men) advanced; but
Mars was their leader, and Pallas Minerva, both golden, and clad in
golden dresses, beautiful and large, along with their armour, radiant
all round, and indeed like gods; but the people were of humbler
size.<span id="footnotetag607"/>

to lay an ambuscade, by a river, where there was a watering-place for
all sorts of cattle, there then they settled, clad in shining steel.
There, apart from the people, sat two spies, watching when they might
perceive the sheep and crooked-horned oxen. These, however, soon
advanced, and two shepherds accompanied them, amusing themselves with
their pipes, for they had not yet perceived the stratagem. Then they,
discerning them, ran in upon them, and immediately slaughtered on all
sides the herds of oxen, and the beautiful flocks of snow-white sheep;
and slew the shepherds besides. But they, when they heard the great

battle on the banks of the river, and wounded one another with their

a strong helmet, fitted to his temples, beautiful and variously
