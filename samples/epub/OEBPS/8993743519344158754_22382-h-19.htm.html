<p>Thetis, having brought Achilles his new armour, and promised to preserve
the body of Patroclus from corruption, he is reconciled to Agamemnon,
and being miraculously invigorated by Minerva, goes forth to battle,
regardless of the prediction of his fate by his horse Xanthus.</p>

ships, bearing the gifts from the god. Her dear son she found lying upon
Patroclus, bitterly lamenting, and his numerous companions were
lamenting around him. But near to him stood the divine of goddesses, and
hung upon his hand and spoke, and addressed him:</p>

<p>“My son, let us suffer him now to lie, grieved although we be, since
first he has been laid low by the counsel of the gods: but do thou
receive these distinguished arms from Vulcan, very beautiful, such as no
man has ever worn upon his shoulders.”</p>
<p>Having thus spoken, the goddess placed the armour before Achilles; and
they, all curiously wrought, clashed aloud. Then tremor seized all the
Myrmidons, nor did any one dare to look directly at them, but they fled
in fear. But when Achilles saw them, the more rage entered him; and his
eyes shone terribly beneath his eyelids, like a flame; and he was
delighted, holding in his hands the splendid gifts of the god. But after
he had delighted his mind, beholding these artificial works, he
immediately addressed to his mother winged words:</p>
<p>“Mother mine, the god hath indeed given arms, such as are fit to be
works of immortals, nor that a mortal man could make. Truly now will I
arm myself; but I very much fear lest, in the meantime, the flies,
having entered the gallant son of Menœtius, by his spear-inflicted
wounds, create maggots, and pollute the corse, (for life in it is
destroyed,) and all the parts of the body grow putrid.”</p>
<p>But him the silver-footed goddess Thetis then answered:</p>
<p>“My child, let not these things be a care to thy mind. I will endeavour
to drive away from him the fierce swarms, the flies which devour heroes
slain in battle. For although he lie an entire year, his body shall
always be uncorrupted, or even better. But do thou, having summoned the
Grecian heroes to an assembly, having renounced thy wrath towards
Agamemnon, the shepherd of the people, arm thyself quickly for war, and
put on thy might.”</p>
<p>Thus, therefore, having spoken, she infused into him the most daring
courage, and then instilled into Patroclus, through the nostrils,
ambrosia and ruby nectar,<span id="footnotetag620"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-19.htm.html#footnote620" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">620</sup></a> that his body might be uncorrupted.</p>

<p>But noble Achilles went along the shore of the sea, shouting fearfully,
and aroused the Grecian heroes; so that even those who used formerly to
remain in the assemblage of the ships, both those who were pilots, and
who held the rudders of the ships, and the pursers [who] were at the
ships, dispensers of food, even these then indeed went to the assembly,
because Achilles appeared, for he had long abstained from the grievous
battle. And two servants of Mars, the warlike son of Tydeus, and noble
Ulysses, went limping, leaning upon a spear; for they still had painful
wounds; and advancing, they sat in the front seats. But last came the
king of men, Agamemnon, having a wound; for him also, in the sharp
battle, Coon, son of Antenor, had wounded with his brazen spear. Then
when all the Greeks were assembled, swift-footed Achilles, rising up
amongst them, said:</p>
<p>“Son of Atreus, this would surely have been somewhat better for both
thee and me,<span id="footnotetag621"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-19.htm.html#footnote621" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">621</sup></a> when we two, grieved at heart, raged with
soul-devouring contention for the sake of a girl. Would that Diana had
slain her with an arrow in the ships on that day, when wasting, I took
Lyrnessus; then indeed so many Greeks had not seized the mighty ground
in their teeth under the hands of the enemy, I being continually
enraged. This however was better for Hector and the Trojans, but I think
the Greeks will long remember the contention of you and me. But let us
leave these things as passed, although grieved, subduing from necessity
the soul within our bosoms. And now I terminate my wrath, nor is it at
all fit that I always obstinately be enraged; but come quickly, incite
the long-haired Achæans to battle, in order that still I may make trial
of the Trojans, going against them; if they wish to pass the night at
the ships; but of them I think that any will very gladly bend the knee,
whoever shall escape out of the destructive fight from my spear.”</p>

<p>Thus he spoke; but the well-greaved Greeks rejoiced, the magnanimous son
of Peleus renouncing his wrath. But them, the king of men, Agamemnon,
also addressed out of the same place, from his seat, nor advancing into
the midst:</p>
<p>“O friends! heroes of the Greeks, servants of Mars, it is becoming

daughter of Jove, who injures all. Her feet are tender, for she does not

injured even Jove, who, they say, is the most powerful of men and gods;

Alemene was about to bring forth mighty Hercules in well-walled Thebes.
He indeed, boasting, had said among all the gods:</p>

deficient the number of months; but kept back the delivery of Alemene,
and restrained the Ilithyiæ; and herself bearing the message, addressed
Jove, the son of Saturn:</p>

Eurystheus, the son of Perseus, thy offspring; nor is it unbecoming that
he should govern the Argives.”</p>
<p>“Thus she spoke; but sharp grief smote him in his deep mind; and
immediately he seized Até by her head of shining curls, enraged in his
mind, and swore a powerful oath, that Até, who injures all, should never
again return to Olympus and the starry heaven.</p>
<p>“Thus saying, he cast her from the starry heaven, whirling her round in

the Greeks at the sterns of the ships, was not able to forget the wrong
which I had formerly foolishly committed. But since I have suffered
harm, and Jove has taken away my reason, I am willing again to appease
thee, and to give infinite presents. But arise to the battle, and incite
the other people, and I myself [will pledge myself] to furnish all the
presents, as many as noble Ulysses yesterday, going to thee, promised in
thy tents. Yet, if thou wilt, wait a little, although hastening to
battle, and my servants, taking the presents from my ship, shall bring
them, that thou mayest see that I will present [thee] with appeasing
offerings.”</p>
<p>But him swift-footed Achilles answering, addressed; “Most glorious son
of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, whether thou wilt furnish gifts, as

quickly be mindful of the contest; for it is not fitting to waste time

some one may again behold Achilles among the front ranks, destroying the
phalanxes of the Trojans with his brazen spear, so also let some one of

<p>But him Ulysses, of many wiles, answering, addressed: “Not thus, brave
as thou art, O godlike Achilles, urge on the sons of the Greeks,
fasting, towards Ilium, about to fight with the Trojans; for the
conflict will not be for a short time only, when once the phalanxes of
men shall mingle, and a god breathe might into both. But command the
Greeks to be fed at the ships with food and wine, for this is might and
vigour. For a man, unrefreshed by food, would not be able to fight
against [the enemy] all day to the setting sun; for although he might
desire in his mind to fight, yet his limbs gradually grow languid, and
thirst and hunger come upon him, and his knees fail him as he goes. The
man, on the other hand, who is satiated with wine and food, fights all
day with hostile men, the heart within his breast is daring, nor are his
limbs at all fatigued before that all retire from battle. But come,
dismiss the people, and order a repast to be made ready; and let the
king of men, Agamemnon, bring the gifts into the midst of the assembly,
that all the Greeks may see them with their eyes, and thou mayest be
delighted in thy mind. Let him, moreover, swear an oath to thee,
standing up among the Greeks, that he has never ascended her bed, nor
has been mingled with her, as is the custom, O king, of men and wives;
and to thee thyself, also, let the soul within thy breast be placid.
Then let him next conciliate thee by a rich banquet within his tents,
that thou mayest not have aught wanting of redress. And for the future,
O son of Atreus, thou wilt be more just towards another; for it is by no
means unworthy that a king should appease a man, when he<span id="footnotetag631"/>

have given offence.”</p>

<p>But him the king of men, Agamemnon, in return addressed:</p>
<p>“I rejoice, O son of Laërtes, having heard thy speech, for with
propriety hast thou gone through and enumerated all things. These things
I am willing to swear, and my mind orders me, in presence of a god, nor
will I perjure myself. But let Achilles remain here, at least for a
little while, though hastening to battle, and do all ye others remain
assembled, until they bring the gifts from my tent, and we strike
faithful leagues. To thyself, however, [O Ulysses], I give this charge,
and order thee, selecting the principal youths of all the Greeks, to
bear from my ship the gifts, as many as we yesterday promised that we
should give to Achilles, and to lead [hither] the women. But let
Talthybius also quickly prepare for me through the wide army of the
Greeks, a boar to sacrifice to Jove and the sun.”</p>
<p>Him answering, swift-footed Achilles then addressed:</p>
<p>“Most glorious son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, at some other time
ought they rather to attend to these things, when any cessation of
battle hereafter be, and so much ardour be not in my bosom: but at
present those lie mangled, whom Hector, son of Priam, subdued, when Jove
gave him the glory: but ye urge [them] to food! Now indeed I should
excite the sons of the Greeks to fight, fasting, but with the setting
sun, to prepare a large supper, after we have revenged our disgrace.
Before that neither drink nor food shall pass down my throat, my
companion being slain, who lies in my tent, torn with the sharp brass,
turned towards the vestibule, whilst his comrades mourn around these
things are not a care to my mind, but slaughter and bloodshed, and the
dreadful groans of heroes.”</p>
<p>But him much-scheming Ulysses answering, addressed:</p>
<p>“O Achilles, son of Peleus, by far the bravest of the Greeks, thou art
superior indeed to me, and not a little more valiant with the spear, but
I indeed excel thee much in prudence; because I was born before thee,
and know more: wherefore let thy mind be restrained by my words. Soon is
there a satiety of contest to the men, a most abundant crop of whom the
brass pours upon the earth; but the harvest is very small, when Jove,
who is the umpire of the battle of men, inclines his scales. It is by no
means fit that the Greeks should lament the dead with the stomach, for
in great numbers and one upon another are they every day falling; when
therefore could any one respire from toil? But it is necessary to bury
him, whosoever may die, having a patient mind, weeping for a day.<span id="footnotetag632"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-19.htm.html#footnote632" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">632</sup></a>
But as many as survive the hateful combat should be mindful of drinking
and of food, in order that we may ever the more ceaselessly contend with
our enemies, clad as to our bodies in impenetrable brass; nor let any of
the troops lie by awaiting another exhortation. For evilly will that
exhortation come upon him, whoever may be left at the ships of the
Greeks; but advancing in a body, let us stir up the keen battle against
the horse-breaking Trojans.”</p>

Meges, son of Phyleus, Thoas, and Meriones, Lycomedes, son of Creon, and
Melanippus; and they proceeded to go towards the tent of Agamemnon, son

perfected. Seven tripods they bore from the tent, which he had promised

forth seven blameless women, skilled in works, but the eighth was

presents, and placed them in the midst of the assembly; but Agamemnon
rose up; and Talthybius, like unto a god in his voice, stood beside the
shepherd of the people, holding a boar in his hands. Then the son of
Atreus, drawing the knife with his hands, which always hung by the
great scabbard of his sword, cutting off the forelock of the boar,
prayed, lifting up his hands to Jove; but all the Greeks sat in silence
in the same spot, listening in a becoming manner to the king. But
praying, he spoke, looking towards the wide heaven:</p>

but inviolate has she remained in my tents. But if any of these things
be false, may the gods inflict on me those very many distresses which
they inflict when men sin in swearing.”</p>
<p>He said, and cut the throat of the boar with the ruthless brass; which
Talthybius, whirling round, cast into the mighty water of the hoary sea,
as food for fishes. But Achilles, rising, said among the war-loving
Greeks:</p>
<p>“O father Jove, certainly thou givest great calamities to men; for never
could Atrides have so thoroughly aroused the indignation in my bosom,
nor foolish, led away the girl, I being unwilling, but Jove for some
intent wished death should happen to many Greeks. But now go to the
repast, that we may join battle.”</p>

<p>Thus she spoke, weeping; and the women lamented for Patroclus, as a

were collected the elders of the Greeks, entreating him to take
refreshment; but he, moaning, refused:</p>
<p>“I entreat [you], if any of my beloved companions would be obedient to
me, bid me not satiate my heart with food or drink, since heavy grief
hath invaded me; but I will wait entirely till the setting sun, and will
endure.”</p>

remained; and noble Ulysses, Nestor, Idomeneus, and the aged knight

<p>“Surely once, thou too, O unhappy one! dearest of my companions, wouldst
thyself have set before me a plentiful feast, within my tent, speedily
and diligently, when the Greeks hastened to make tearful war upon the
horse-breaking Trojans. But now thou liest mangled; but my heart is
without drink and food, though they are within, from regret for thee;
for I could not suffer anything worse, not even if I were to hear of my
father being dead, who now perhaps sheds the tender tear in Phthia from
the want of such a son; while I, in a foreign people, wage war against
the Trojans, for the sake of detested Helen: or him, my beloved son, who
is nurtured for me at Scyros, if indeed he still lives, godlike
Neoptolemus. For formerly the mind within my bosom hoped that I alone
should perish here in Troy, far from steed-nourishing Argos, and that
thou shouldst return to Phthia, that thou mightst lead back my son in
thy black ship from Scyros, and mightst show him everything, my
property, my servants, and my great, lofty-domed abode. For now I
suppose that Peleus is either totally deceased, or that he, barely
alive, suffers pain from hateful old age, and that he is continually
expecting bad news respecting me, when he shall hear of my being dead.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, weeping; and the elders also groaned, remembering, each
of them, the things which they had left in their dwellings. But the son
of Saturn felt compassion, seeing them weeping, and immediately to
Minerva addressed winged words:</p>
<p>“O daughter mine, thou entirely now desertest thy valiant hero. Is
Achilles then no longer at all a care to thee in thy mind? He himself is
sitting before his lofty-beaked ships, bewailing his dear companion;
while the others have gone to a banquet; but he is unrefreshed and
unfed. Go, therefore, instil into his breast nectar and delightful
ambrosia, that hunger may come not upon him.”</p>
<p>So saying, he urged on Minerva, who was before eager. But she, like unto
a broad-winged, shrill-voiced harpy, leaped down from the heavens
through the air. The Greeks, however, were then arming themselves
throughout the camp, when she instilled into the bosom of Achilles
nectar and delightful ambrosia, that unpleasant hunger might not come
upon his limbs. Then she went to the solid mansion of her powerful sire,
and they, apart, poured forth from the swift ships.</p>
<p>And as when thick snow-flakes fly down from Jove, beneath the force of
the cold, air-clearing Boreas; so from the ships were borne out crowded
helmets, shining brightly, and bossed shields, strong-cavitied corslets,
and ashen spears. But the sheen reached to heaven, and all the earth
around smiled beneath the splendour of the brass; and a trampling of the
feet of men arose beneath. In the midst noble Achilles was armed, and
there was a gnashing of his teeth, and his eyes shone like a blaze of
fire; but intolerable grief entered his heart within him, and, enraged
against the Trojans, he put on the gifts of the god, which Vulcan,
toiling, had fabricated for him. First around his legs he placed the
beautiful greaves, joined with silver clasps, next he put on the corslet
round his breast, and suspended from his shoulders the brazen,
silver-studded sword; then he seized the shield, large and solid, the
sheen of which went to a great distance, as of the moon.<span id="footnotetag639"/> <a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-19.htm.html#footnote639" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">639</sup></a>
And as when from the sea the blaze of a burning fire shines to mariners, which
is lit aloft amongst the mountains in a solitary place; but the storm bears
them against their inclination away from their friends over the fishy deep; so
from the shield of Achilles, beautiful and skilfully made, the brightness
reached the sky. But raising it, he placed the strong helmet upon his head; and
the helmet, crested with horse-hair, shone like a star; and the golden tufts
which Vulcan had diffused thick around the cone were shaken. Then noble
Achilles tried himself in his arms if they would fit him, and if his fair limbs
would move freely in them; but they were like wings to him, and lifted up the
shepherd of the people. And from its sheath he drew forth his paternal spear,
heavy, great, and stout, which no other of the Greeks was able to brandish, but
Achilles alone knew how to hurl it—a Pelian ash, which Chiron had cut for
his father from the top of Pelion, to be a destruction to heroes. But Automedon
and Alcimus, harnessing the steeds, yoked them; and beautiful collars were upon
them. They put the bridles into their jaws, and drew back the reins towards the
well-glued car, when Automedon, seizing the shining lash, fitted to his hand,
leaped into the car; Achilles, armed for battle, mounted behind him, glittering
in his armour like the shining sun; and terribly he gave command to the horses
of his sire:

a different manner to bring back your charioteer in safety to the body

dead, like Patroclus.”</p>
<p>But from beneath the yoke, Xanthus, his swift-footed steed, addressed
him, and immediately hung down his head, and his whole mane, drooping
from the ring which was near the yoke, reached the ground. But the
white-armed goddess Juno gave him the power of speech:</p>
<p>“Now, at least, we will bear thee safe, O impetuous Achilles: but the
fatal day draws nigh to thee; nor are we to blame, but a mighty deity
and violent destiny. For not by our laziness, or sloth, have the Trojans
stripped the armour from the shoulders of Patroclus; but the bravest of
the gods, whom fair-haired Latona brought forth, slew him among the
front ranks, and gave glory to Hector. And [though] we can run even with
the blast of Zephyrus, which they say is the most fleet, yet to thyself
it is fated that thou shouldst be violently subdued by a god and a man.”</p>
<p>Of him, having thus spoken, the Furies restrained the voice: but him
swift-footed Achilles, greatly indignant, addressed:</p>
<p>“O Xanthus, why dost thou predict my death to me? For it is not at all
necessary for thee. Well do I myself know that it is my fate to perish
here, far away from my dear father and mother. Nevertheless I will not
cease before the Trojans are abundantly satiated with war.”</p>

solid-hoofed steeds.</p>
