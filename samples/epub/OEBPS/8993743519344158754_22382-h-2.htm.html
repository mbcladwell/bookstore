<h2>BOOK THE SECOND.</h2>
<h4 id="pgepubid00009">ARGUMENT.</h4>
<p>Jove sends a dream to Agamemnon, in consequence of which he re-assembles
the army. Thersites is punished for his insolent speech, and the troops
are restrained from seeking a return homewards. The catalogue of the
ships and the forces of the confederates follows.</p>

night: but Jove sweet sleep possessed not; but he was pondering in his
mind how he might honour Achilles, and destroy many at the ships of the
Greeks. But this device appeared best to him in his mind, to send a
fatal dream<span id="footnotetag72"/>

spoke winged words:</p>
<p>“Haste away, pernicious dream, to the swift ships of the Greeks. Going
into the tent of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, utter very accurately
everything as I shall command thee. Bid him arm the long-haired
Achæans<span id="footnotetag73"/>

<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-2.htm.html#footnote75" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">75</sup></a> accordingly departed, as soon as it
heard the mandate. And quickly it came to the swift ships of the Greeks,
and went unto Agamemnon, the son of Atreus. But him it found sleeping in
his tent, and ambrosial slumber was diffused around. And he stood over
his head, like unto Nestor, the son of Neleus, him, to wit, whom
Agamemnon honoured most of the old men. To him assimilating himself, the
divine dream addressed him:</p>

(return) </a> In defence of this cheating conduct of Jove, at
   which Plato was much scandalized, Coleridge, p. 154, observes:
   “The οὖλος ὄνειρος was a lying spirit, which the father of gods
   and men had a supreme right to commission for the purpose of
   working out his ultimate will.”</p>
<p>“Sleepest thou, son of the warrior, horse-taming Atreus? It becomes not
a counsel-giving man, to whom the people have been intrusted, and to
whom so many things are a care, to sleep all the night. But now quickly
attend to me; for I am a messenger to thee from Jove, who, although far
distant, greatly regards and pities thee. He orders thee to arm the
long-haired Greeks with all their array, for now mayest thou take the
wide-wayed city of the Trojans, since the immortals, who possess the
Olympian mansions, no longer think dividedly; for Juno, supplicating,
hath bent all [to her will], and woes from Jove are impending over the
Trojans. But do thou preserve this in thy recollection, nor let
forgetfulness possess thee, when sweet sleep shall desert thee.”</p>
<p>Thus then having spoken, he departed, and left him there pondering these
things in his mind, which were not destined to be accomplished. For he,
foolish, thought that he would take the city of Priam on that day; nor
knew he the deeds which Jupiter was really devising; for even he was
about yet to impose additional hardships and sorrows upon both Trojans
and Greeks, through mighty conflicts. But he awoke from his sleep, and
the heavenly voice was diffused around him. He sat up erect, and put on
his soft tunic, beautiful, new; and around him he threw his large cloak.
And he bound his beautiful sandals on his shining feet, and slung from
his shoulders the silver-studded sword. He also took his paternal
sceptre, ever imperishable, with which he went to the ships of the
brazen-mailed Greeks.</p>

assembly. They therefore summoned them, and the people were very
speedily assembled. First the assembly of magnanimous elders sat at the
ship of Nestor, the Pylus-born king. Having called them together, he
propounded a prudent counsel:</p>

<p>“Hear me, my friends: a divine dream came to me in sleep, during the
ambrosial night, very like unto the noble Nestor, in form, in stature,
and in mien. And it stood above my head, and addressed me: ‘Sleepest
thou, son of the warrior, horse-taming Atreus? It becomes not a
counsellor, to whom the people have been intrusted, and to whom so many
things are a care, to sleep all the night. But now quickly attend to me;
for I am a messenger to thee from Jove, who, although far distant,
greatly regards and pities thee. He orders thee to arm the long-haired
Greeks with all their array, for now mayest thou take the wide-wayed
city of the Trojans; for the immortals, who possess the Olympian
mansions, no longer think dividedly, for Juno, supplicating, has bent
all [to her will], and woes from Jove are impending over the Trojans;
but do thou preserve this in thy thoughts.’ Thus having spoken, flying
away, it departed; but sweet sleep resigned me. But come, [let us try]
if by any means we can arm the sons of the Greeks. But first with words
will I sound their inclinations, as is right, and I will command them to
fly with their many-benched ships; but do you restrain them with words,
one in one place, another in another.”</p>
<p>He indeed having thus spoken, sat down; but Nestor, who was king of
sandy Pylus, rose up, who wisely counselling, harangued them, and said:</p>
<p>“O friends, generals and counsellors of the Argives, if any other of the
Greeks had told this dream, we should have pronounced it a fabrication,
and withdrawn ourselves [from the reciter]. But now he has seen it, who
boasts himself [to be] by far the greatest man in the army. But come on,
if by any means we can arm the sons of the Greeks.”</p>
<p>Thus then having spoken, he began to depart from the assembly; and they,
the sceptre-bearing princes, arose, and obeyed the shepherd of the
tribes, and the hosts rushed forward. Even as the swarms of clustering
bees,<span id="footnotetag79"/>

here, and some there; thus of these [Greeks] many nations from the ships
and tents kept marching in troops in front of the steep shore to the
assembly. And in the midst of them blazed Rumour, messenger of Jove,
urging them to proceed; and they kept collecting together. The assembly
was tumultuous, and the earth groaned beneath, as the people seated
themselves, and there was a clamour; but nine heralds vociferating
restrained them, if by any means they would cease from clamour, and
hear the Jove-nurtured princes. With difficulty at length the people sat
down, and were kept to their respective<span id="footnotetag81"/>

their clamour, when king Agamemnon arose, holding the sceptre, which
Vulcan had laboriously wrought. Vulcan in the first place gave it to

<p>“O friends, Grecian heroes, servants of Mars, Jove, the son of Saturn,
has entangled me in a heavy misfortune. Cruel, who before indeed
promised to me, and vouchsafed by his nod, that I should return home,
having destroyed well-fortified Ilium. But now he has devised an evil
deception, and commands me to return to Argos, inglorious, after I have
lost many of my people. So forsooth it appears to be agreeable to
all-powerful Jove, who has already overthrown the citadels of many
cities, yea, and will even yet overthrow them, for transcendent is his
power. For this were disgraceful even for posterity to hear, that so
brave and so numerous a people of the Greeks warred an ineffectual war,
and fought with fewer men; but as yet no end has appeared. For if we,
Greeks and Trojans, having struck a faithful league,<span id="footnotetag85"/>

both should be numbered, and [wished] to select the Trojans, on the one
hand, as many as are townsmen; and if we Greeks, on the other hand, were
to be divided into decades, and to choose a single man of the Trojans to
pour out wine [for each decade], many decades would be without a
cupbearer.<span id="footnotetag86"/>

than the Trojans who dwell in the city. But there are spear-wielding
auxiliaries from many cities, who greatly stand in my way, and do not
permit me wishing to destroy the well-inhabited city. Already have nine
years of mighty Jove passed away, and now the timbers of our ships have
rotted, and the ropes have become untwisted.<span id="footnotetag87"/>

with shouting rushed to the ships, but from beneath their feet the dust
stood suspended aloft; and some exhorted one another to seize the
vessels, and drag them to the great ocean; and they began to clear the
channels. The shout of them, eager [to return] home, rose to the sky,
and they withdrew the stays from beneath the vessels. Then truly a
return had happened to the Argives, contrary to destiny, had not Juno
addressed herself to Minerva:</p>

the azure-eyed goddess Minerva refuse compliance. But she, hastening,
descended down from the summits of Olympus, and quickly reached the
swift ships of the Achæans. Then she found Ulysses, of equal weight with
Jove in counsel, standing still; nor was he touching his well-benched,
sable bark, since regret affected him in heart and mind. But standing
near him, azure-eyed Minerva said:</p>

(return) </a> This is Nägelsbach’s spirited rendering of οίκαδε
   περ.</p>
<p>Thus spoke Thersites, reviling Agamemnon, the shepherd of the people.
But godlike Ulysses immediately stood beside him, and eyeing him with
scowling brow, reproached him with harsh language:</p>
<p>“Thersites, reckless babbler! noisy declaimer though thou be, refrain,
nor be forward singly to strive with princes; for I affirm that there is
not another mortal more base than thou, as many as came with the son of
Atreus to Ilium. Wherefore do not harangue, having kings in thy mouth,
nor cast reproaches against them, nor be on the watch for a return. Not
as yet indeed do we certainly know how these matters will turn out,
whether we sons of the Greeks shall return to our advantage or
disadvantage. Wherefore, now thou sittest reviling Agamemnon, son of
Atreus, the leader of the people, because the Grecian heroes give him
very many gifts, whilst thou, insulting, dost harangue. But I declare to
thee, which shall also be accomplished: if ever again I catch thee
raving, as now thou art, no longer may the head of Ulysses rest upon his
shoulders, and no longer may I be called the father of Telemachus,
unless I seizing thee divest thee of thy very garments, thy coat, thy
cloak, and those which cover thy loins; and send thyself weeping to the
swift ships, having beaten thee out of the assembly with severe blows.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, and smote him with the sceptre upon the back and the
shoulders; but he writhed, and plenteous tears fell from him, and a
bloody weal arose under the sceptre upon his back. But he sat down and
trembled; and grieving, looking foolish, he wiped away the tears. They,
although chagrined, laughed heartily at him, and thus one would say,
looking towards the person next him:</p>
<p>“O strange! surely ten thousand good deeds has Ulysses already
performed, both originating good counsels, and arousing the war. But now
has he done this by far the best deed amongst the Greeks, in that he has
restrained this foul-mouthed reviler from his harangues. Surely his
petulant mind will not again urge him to chide the kings with scurrilous
language.”</p>
<p>Thus spake the multitude; but Ulysses, the sacker of cities, arose,
holding the sceptre, and beside him azure-eyed Minerva, likened unto a
herald, ordered the people to be silent, that at the same time the sons
of the Greeks, both first and last, might hear his speech, and weigh his
counsel. He wisely counselling, addressed them, and said:</p>
<p>“O son of Atreus, the Greeks wish to render thee now, O king, the
meanest amongst articulately-speaking men; nor perform their promise to
thee,<span id="footnotetag100"/>

Argos, that thou shouldest return home, having destroyed well-fortified

having been grieved. For he is impatient who is absent even for a single

it is [now] the ninth revolving year since we have been lingering here.
Wherefore I am not indignant that the Greeks are growing impatient by
their curved ships; but still it would be disgraceful both to remain
here so long, and to return ineffectually. Endure, my friends, and
remain yet awhile, that we may know whether Calchas prophesies truly or
not. For this we well know, and ye are all witnesses, whom the Fates of
death carried not off yesterday and the day before, when the ships of
the Greeks were collected at Aulis, bearing evils to Priam and the
Trojans, and we round about the fountain, at the sacred altars, offered
perfect hecatombs to the immortals, beneath a beauteous plane-tree,
whence flowed limpid water.<span id="footnotetag103"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-2.htm.html#footnote103" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">103</sup></a> There a great prodigy appeared; a
serpent, spotted on the back, horrible, which the Olympian himself had
sent forth into the light, having glided out from beneath the altar,
proceeded forthwith to the plane-tree. And there were the young of a
sparrow, an infant offspring, on a topmost branch, cowering amongst the
foliage, eight in number; but the mother, which had brought forth the
young ones, was the ninth. Thereupon he devoured them, twittering
piteously, while the mother kept fluttering about, lamenting her dear
young; but then, having turned himself about, he seized her by the wing,
screaming around. But after he had devoured the young of the sparrow,
and herself, the god who had displayed him rendered him very portentous,
for the son of wily Saturn changed him into a stone; but we, standing
by, were astonished at what happened. Thus, therefore, the dreadful
portents of the gods approached the hecatombs. Calchas, then,
immediately addressed us, revealing from the gods: ‘Why are ye become
silent, ye waving-crested Greeks? For us, indeed, provident Jove has
shown a great sign, late, of late accomplishment, the renown of which
shall never perish. As this [serpent] has devoured the young of the
sparrow, eight in number, and herself, the mother which brought out the
brood, was the ninth, so must we for as many years<span id="footnotetag104"/>

but in the tenth we shall take the wide-wayed city.’ He indeed thus
harangued: and all these things are now in course of accomplishment. But
come, ye well-greaved Greeks, remain all here, until we shall take the
great city of Priam.”</p>

to another; nor shall the advice which I am about to utter be discarded.
Separate the troops, Agamemnon, according to their tribes and clans,

on account of a maid with opposing words: but I began quarrelling. But
if ever we shall consult in common, no longer then shall there be a
respite from evil to the Trojans, no, not for ever so short a time. Now
go to your repast, that we may join battle. Let each one well sharpen

horse shall sweat, dragging the well-polished chariot. But whomsoever I
shall perceive desirous to remain at the beaked ships, apart from the
battle, it will not be possible for him afterwards to escape the dogs
and the birds.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, but the Argives shouted aloud, as when a wave [roars]
against the steep shore, when the south wind urges it, coming against an
out-jutting rock; for this the billows from all kinds of winds never
forsake, when they may be here or there. And rising up, the people
hastened forth, scattered from ship to ship, and raised up smoke among
the tents, and took repast. And one sacrificed to some one of the
immortal gods, and [another to another,] praying to escape death and the
slaughter of war. But king Agamemnon offered up a fat ox, of five years
old, to the powerful son of Saturn, and summoned the elder chiefs of all

<p>“O Jove, most glorious, most great dark-cloud-collector, dwelling in the

<p>Thus he spoke, nor as yet did the son of Saturn assent, but he accepted
the offering, and increased abundant toil. But after they had prayed,
and thrown forward the bruised barley, they first drew back [the neck of
the victim,] slew it, and flayed it, then cut out the thighs, and
covered them in the fat, having arranged it in a double fold, and then
laid the raw flesh upon them. And they roasted them upon leafless
billets. Next, having pierced the entrails with spits, they held them
over the fire. But then, after the thighs were roasted, and they had
tasted the entrails, they cut the rest of them into small pieces, and
fixed them on spits, and roasted them skilfully, and drew them all off
[the spits]. But when they had ceased from labour, and had prepared the
banquet, they feasted; nor did their soul in anywise lack a due
allowance of the feast. But when they had dismissed the desire of drink
and food, them the Gerenian knight Nestor began to address:</p>

were hastily assembled, and the Jove-nurtured kings, who were with the
son of Atreus, kept hurrying about arranging them. But amongst them was

by city-wasting Oïleus, marshalled them.</p>

Œchalia, the city of Œchalian Eurytus; Podalirius and Machaon, two

(return) </a> Grote, vol. i. p. 348, remarks that the “renown of
   Podalirius and Machaon was further prolonged in the subsequent
   poem of Arctinus, the Iliu-Persis, wherein the one was
   represented as unrivalled in surgical operations, the other as
   sagacious in detecting and appreciating morbid symptoms. It was
   Podalirius who first noticed the glaring eyes and disturbed
   deportment which preceded the suicide of Ajax.”</p>
<p>Those who possessed Ormenium, and the fountain Hyperia, and those who
possessed Asterium and the white tops of Titanus; these Eurypylus, the
brave son of Evæmon, commanded. With him forty dark ships followed.</p>
<p>Those who possessed Argissa, and inhabited Gyrtone, and Orthe, and
Elone, and the white city Oloosson: these the stout warrior Polypœtes,
son of Pirithous, whom immortal Jove begat, commanded. Him renowned
Hippodamia brought forth by Pirithous, on the day when he took vengeance
on the shaggy Centaurs, and drove them from Mount Pelion, and chased
them to the Æthiceans. He was not the only leader; with him commanded
warlike Leonteus, son of magnamimous Coronus, the son of Cœneus. With
these forty dark ships followed.</p>
<p>But Gyneus led two-and-twenty ships from Cyphus. Him the Enienes
followed, and the Peræbi, stout warriors, who placed their habitations
by chilly Dodona, and those who tilled the fields about delightful
Titaresius, which pours its fair-flowing stream into the Peneus; nor is
it mingled with silver-eddied Peneus, but flows on the surface of it
like oil. For it is a streamlet of the Stygian wave, the dreadful
[pledge of] oath.</p>
<p>Prothoüs, son of Tenthredon, commanded the Magnetes, who dwell about the
Peneus, and leaf-quivering Pelion: these swift Prothoüs led; and with
him forty dark ships followed.</p>
<p>These then were the leaders and chieftains of the Greeks. Do thou, then,
O muse, tell me who was the most excellent of these, of the kings and
their steeds, who followed the son of Atreus to Troy. The steeds of the
descendant of Pheres were indeed by far the most excellent, which
Eumelus drove, swift as birds, like in hair, like in age, and level in

against the son of Atreus, Agamemnon, the shepherd of the people. But
his forces meantime amused themselves with quoits and javelins, hurling

<p>But swift-footed Iris came from aegis-bearing Jove, a messenger to the
Trojans, with a woeful announcement. They all, collected together, both
young and old, were holding councils at the gates of Priam. But
swift-footed Iris standing near, accosted them: and she likened herself
in voice to Polites, son of Priam, who, trusting to the swiftness of his
feet, sat at watch for the Trojans on the top of the tomb<span id="footnotetag139"/>

Æsyetus, watching when the Greeks should set forth from the ships. To
him having likened herself, swift-footed Iris addressed them:</p>
<p>“Old man, ever are injudicious words pleasing to thee, as formerly in
time of peace: but now has an inevitable war arisen. Truly I have
already very often been present at the conflicts of heroes, but never
have I beheld such brave and numerous forces. For very like unto the
leaves or the sand proceed they through the plain, about to fight for
the city. Hector, for it is to thee in particular I give advice: and do
thou act thus; for many are the allies through the great city of Priam;
and different are the languages<span id="footnotetag140"/>

each hero command those of whom he is the chief: but do thou,
marshalling the citizens, be leader of them.”</p>
<p>Thus she said. But Hector was not ignorant of the voice of the goddess;
and he instantly dismissed the council, and they rushed to arms. And the
portals were opened, and the troops rushed out, both foot and horse; and
much tumult arose.</p>
<p>Now there is a certain lofty mound before the city, far in the plain,
that may be run round,<span id="footnotetag141"/>

silver, commanded the Halizonians. Chromis and the augur Ennomus
commanded the Mysians, but he avoided not sable death through his skill
