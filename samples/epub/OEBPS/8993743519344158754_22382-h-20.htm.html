<h2>BOOK THE TWENTIETH</h2>
<h4 id="pgepubid00046">ARGUMENT.</h4>
<p>Jove permits the gods to join in the battle, and they take their
respective places on either side. Æneas engages Achilles, but is rescued
by Neptune. Hector, in revenge for the death of his brother Polydorus,
also attacks Achilles, and is only saved from death by the intervention
of Apollo. Achilles then slays many Trojans.</p>
<p class="p2">
Thus around thee, O son of Peleus, were the Achæans armed, insatiable in
fight, beside their crooked ships; and the Trojans, on the other side,
on the acclivity<span id="footnotetag640"/>

the gods to an assembly, from the top of many-valleyed Olympus, and she,
going round, ordered them to proceed to the palace of Jove. Nor was any
one of the rivers absent, save Oceanus, nor of the nymphs who inhabit
the pleasant groves and springs of rivers, and the grassy meads. Then,
coming to the habitation of cloud-compelling Jove, they sat down upon
shining polished benches, which Vulcan with cunning skill had made for
father Jove. Thus were they assembled within the palace of Jove: nor did
Neptune disobey the goddess, but he came to them from the sea. Then he
sat in the midst, and inquired the design of Jove:</p>

(return) </a> See x. 160; xi. 56.</p>
<p>“Why again, O hurler of the glowing lightning, hast thou summoned the
gods to an assembly? Dost thou deliberate anything respecting the
Trojans and Greeks? For now their combat and the battle are on the point
of being kindled.”</p>
<p>But him cloud-compelling Jove answering, addressed:</p>
<p>“Thou knowest, O earth-shaker, my design within my breast, [and] for
whose sake I have assembled you; for though about to perish, they are a
care to me. I will, however, remain sitting on the top of Olympus,
whence looking, I shall delight my soul; but depart the rest of you,
that ye may go to the Trojans and Greeks. Give aid to both, according as
is the inclination of each. For if Achilles alone shall fight against
the Trojans, they will not even for a little sustain the swift-footed
son of Peleus. Formerly even beholding him, they fled terrified; but now
when he is grievously enraged in his mind on account of his companion, I
fear lest he overthrow the wall, even contrary to fate.”</p>
<p>Thus spoke Saturnian Jove, and he stirred up the unyielding<span id="footnotetag641"/>

contest; and the gods hastened to proceed to the battle, having
discordant minds. Juno, indeed, and Pallas Minerva [went] to the
assemblage of the ships, as well as earth-shaking Neptune, and useful
Mercury, who excelled in a prudent mind, with whom went Vulcan, looking
savage in his might, limping, and under him his weak limbs moved with
all their force. But to the Trojans [went] crest-tossing Mars, and with
him unshorn Phœbus,<span id="footnotetag642"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-20.htm.html#footnote642" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">642</sup></a> and Diana, delighting in archery, Latona,
Xanthus, and laughter-loving Venus. As long as the gods were apart from
mortal men, so long the Greeks were greatly elated, because Achilles
appeared, for he had long abstained from the dire battle; and a violent
tremor came upon the Trojans, upon each of them as to their limbs,
fearing because they beheld the swift-footed son of Peleus glittering in
arms, equal to man-slaughtering Mars. But after the Olympians had come
to the crowd of men, then arose fierce Contention, the exciter of the
people, and Minerva shouted, sometimes standing beside the trench,
outside the wall, at other times she loudly shouted along the echoing
shores. But Mars yelled aloud on the other side, like unto a dark
whirlwind, keenly animating the Trojans from the lofty city, at other
times running along the Simoïs over Callicolone.<span id="footnotetag643"/>

<p>Thus the blessed gods, inciting both sides, engaged, and among them made
severe contention to break out. But dreadfully from above thundered the
father of gods and men; whilst beneath Neptune shook the boundless earth
and the lofty summits of the mountains. The roots and all the summits of
many-rilled Ida were shaken, and the city of the Trojans, and the ships
of the Greeks. Pluto himself, king of the nether world, trembled
beneath, and leaped up from his throne, terrified, and shouted aloud,
lest earth-shaking Neptune should rend asunder the earth over him, and
disclose to mortals and immortals his mansions, terrible, squalid, which
even the gods loathe. So great a tumult arose from the gods engaging in
combat. Against king Neptune, indeed, stood Phœbus Apollo, having his
winged shafts, and against Mars the azure-eyed goddess Minerva. Opposed
to Juno stood the goddess of the golden bow, huntress Diana, rejoicing
in archery, the sister of Apollo; and opposite Latona, the
preserver,<span id="footnotetag644"/>

deep-eddying river, which the gods call Xanthus, and men the Scamander.</p>

<p>Thus indeed gods went against gods; but Achilles chiefly longed to
penetrate through the crowd against Hector, the son of Priam; for with
his blood his mind particularly ordered him to satiate Mars, the
invincible warrior. But Apollo, exciter of troops, immediately aroused
Æneas against the son of Peleus, and infused into him strong courage.
And he likened himself in voice to Lycaon, the son of Priam, and having
likened himself to him, Apollo, the son of Jove, said:</p>
<p>“O Æneas, counsellor of the Trojans, where are thy threats which, whilst
carousing, thou didst promise to the leaders of the Trojans, that thou
wouldst fight against Achilles, the son of Peleus?”</p>
<p>But him Æneas, answering, addressed in turn:</p>
<p>“Son of Priam, why dost thou order me, not wishing it, these things, to
fight against magnanimous Pelides? For shall I not now for the first
time stand against swift-footed Achilles, but already, on another
occasion, he chased me with his spear from Ida, when he attacked our
cattle, and laid waste Lyrnessus and Pedasus: but Jove preserved me, who
excited my strength and nimble limbs. Certainly I should have been
subdued beneath the hands of Achilles, and Minerva, who, preceding, gave
him victory, and encouraged him to slay the Lelegans and Trojans with
his brazen spear. Wherefore it is not possible that a man should fight
against Achilles, because one of the gods is ever beside him, who averts
destruction. Besides, also, his weapon flies direct, nor stops before it
has pierced through human flesh; though if the deity would extend an
equal scale of victory, not very easily would he conquer me, although he
boasts himself to be all brazen.”</p>
<p>But him again king Apollo, the son of Jove, addressed:</p>
<p>“But do thou also pray, O hero, to the immortal gods, for they say that
thou too art sprung from Venus, the daughter of Jove, but he from an
inferior goddess; for the one is from Jove, and the other from the aged
sea-god. But direct thy invincible brass right against him, nor let him
at all avert thee by haughty words and threats.”</p>
<p>Thus saying, he breathed great courage into the shepherd of the people;
and he advanced through the front ranks, accoutred in shining brass. Nor
did the son of Anchises escape the notice of white-armed Juno, going
against the son of Peleus through the ranks of men; but, calling the
gods together, she addressed them:</p>
<p>“Consider now, both Neptune and Minerva, in your minds, how these things
shall be. This Æneas, accoutred in shining brass, has advanced against
the son of Peleus; and Phœbus Apollo has urged him on. But come, let us,
however, turn him back again; or let some one of us stand by Achilles,
and give him great strength, nor let him at all be wanting in courage;
that he may know that the mightiest of the immortals love him; and that
those, on the contrary, are vain, who hitherto avert war and slaughter
from the Trojans. But we have all come down from Olympus, about to
participate in this battle, lest he should suffer anything among the
Trojans to-day; but hereafter he shall suffer those things, as
many as Fate at his birth wove in his thread [of destiny],<span id="footnotetag645"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-20.htm.html#footnote645" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">645</sup></a> to him,
what time his mother brought him forth. But if Achilles shall not learn
these things from the voice of a god, he will afterwards be afraid when
any god comes against him in battle; for the gods, when made manifest,
are terrible to be seen manifestly.” <span id="footnotetag646"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-20.htm.html#footnote646" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">646</sup></a></p>
<p>But her then earth-shaking Neptune answered:</p>
<p>“Juno, be not beyond reason enraged; nor is it at all necessary. I,
indeed, would not desire that we should engage the other gods in a
battle, since we are much more powerful.<span id="footnotetag647"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-20.htm.html#footnote647" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">647</sup></a> Rather let us, going out
of the way, sit down upon a place of observation,<span id="footnotetag648"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-20.htm.html#footnote648" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">648</sup></a> but the war shall
be a care to mortals. But if Mars shall begin the combat, or Apollo, or
shall restrain Achilles, and not suffer him to fight, then immediately
shall the strife of contention there arise to us; and I think that they,
having very speedily decided it, will return to Olympus, and mix with
the assembly of other gods, violently subdued by necessity under our
hands.”</p>
<p>Thus then having spoken, the azure-haired [god] led the way to the lofty
mound-raised wall of divine Hercules, which the Trojans and Pallas
Minerva had made, that, flying, he might escape from the sea-monster,
when pursued from the shore to the plain. There then Neptune sat down,
and the other gods, and drew an indissoluble cloud around their
shoulders; whilst on the other side they sat upon the tops of
Callicolone, around thee, O archer Apollo, and Mars, the sacker of
cities. Thus they sat on both sides, planning designs, yet both were
unwilling to commence grievous war; but Jove, sitting aloft, cheered
them on. All the plain, however, was filled with them, and glittered
with the brass of men and horses, and the earth echoed under the feet of
them rushing together. But two heroes, by far the most valiant, advanced
towards [each other] into the midst of both armies, eager to
fight,—Æneas, the son of Anchises, and noble Achilles. And first Æneas,
threatening, advanced, nodding with his strong casque; and before his
breast he held his impetuous shield, and shook his brazen spear. But on
the other side Pelides rushed against him like a destructive lion, which
men assembled together, a whole village, are anxious to kill. He,
however, at first despising them, proceeds; but when some one of
vigorous youths has wounded him with a dart, yawning, he collects
himself [for a spring],<span id="footnotetag649"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-20.htm.html#footnote649" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">649</sup></a> and the foam arises round his teeth, and
his valiant soul groans within his breast, and he lashes his sides and
thighs on both sides with his tail, and rouses himself to battle; then,
grimly glaring, he is borne straight on by his strength, if he can kill
some of the men, or is himself destroyed in the first crowd. Thus did
his might and noble soul urge Achilles to go against magnanimous Æneas.
But when now, advancing, they approached each other, swift-footed, noble
Achilles first addressed the other:</p>

<p>But him Æneas answered in turn, and said:</p>
<p>“Do not think, O son of Peleus, to affright me, like an infant boy, with
words; since I also well know how to utter both threats and reproaches.
But we know each other’s race, and we know our parents, hearing the
words of mortal men long since uttered; although by sight, indeed,
neither dost thou know mine, nor I thine. They say, indeed, that thou
art the offspring of renowned Peleus, and of thy mother Thetis, the
fair-haired sea-nymph; whereas I boast myself to be sprung from
magnanimous Anchises, and Venus is my mother. Of these the one or the
other shall this day lament their beloved son; for I think we shall not
return from the battle thus separated by childish words. But if thou
desirest to be taught these matters, that thou mayest well know our race
(for many men know it), cloud-compelling Jove indeed first begat

articulate-speaking men, was not as yet built in the plain, and they
still dwelt at the foot of many-rilled Ida. Dardanus again begat a son,
king Erichthonius, who was then the richest of mortal men; whose three
thousand mares pastured through the marsh, rejoicing in their tender
foals. Boreas, however, was enamoured of some of these when pasturing,
and having likened himself to an azure-maned steed, covered them; and
they, becoming pregnant, brought forth twelve female foals; which when
they bounded upon the fruitful earth, ran over the highest fruit of the
stalks of corn, nor did they break them:<span id="footnotetag653"/>

the broad back of the ocean, they ran along the surface of the ridge of
the hoary sea. But Erichthonius begat Tros, king of the Trojans. From
Tros again were descended three illustrious sons, Ilus, Assaracus, and
godlike Ganymede, who indeed was the handsomest of mortal men; and whom
the gods caught up into heaven, to pour out wine for Jove,<span id="footnotetag654"/>

account of his beauty, he might be with the immortals. Ilus again begat
his renowned son Laomedon; but Laomedon begat Tithonus and Priam,
Lampus, Clytius, and Hicetaon, a branch of Mars; and Assaracus Capys,
who also begat his son Anchises. But Anchises begat me, and Priam noble
Hector. Of this race and blood do I boast myself to be. But Jove
increases and diminishes valour to men, as he pleases; for he is the
most powerful of all. But come, let us no longer talk of these things,
like little boys, standing in the middle combat of the strife. For it is
possible for both to utter very many reproaches, so that a hundred-oared

<p>He spoke, and hurled his brazen spear against the dreadful shield,
terrible [to be seen], and the huge buckler resounded with the stroke of
the javelin. But the son of Peleus, alarmed, held the shield from him
with his strong hand, for he supposed that the long spear of
great-hearted Æneas would easily penetrate; foolish! nor did he reflect
in his mind and soul, that the glorious gifts of the gods are not easy
to be subdued by mortal men, nor to yield. Nor then did the heavy spear
of warlike Æneas penetrate the shield; but the gold stopped it, the gift
of the god. It penetrated, however, through two folds, but there were
still three; since Vulcan had drawn five folds over it, two brazen, two
inside of tin, and one golden; in which the brazen spear was stopped.
But Achilles next sent forth his long-shadowed spear, and struck against
the shield of Æneas, equal on all sides, at the outside edge, where the
thinnest brass ran round it, and the ox-hide was thinnest upon it; but
the Pelian ash broke through, and the shield was crushed by it. But

But he, having escaped the long spear, stood still, but immoderate
sadness was poured over his eyes, terrified, because the weapon had
stuck so near him. But Achilles eagerly sprang upon him, drawing his
sharp sword, and shouting dreadfully. Then Æneas seized in his hand a
stone, a great weight, which not two men could bear, such as men now
are; but he, though alone, easily wielded it. Then indeed had Æneas
smitten him, rushing on, with the stone, either upon the helmet or the
shield, which kept off grievous destruction from him; and Pelides, in
close fight, had taken away his life with the sword, had not
earth-shaking Neptune quickly perceived it, and immediately addressed
this speech to the immortal gods:</p>

<p>But him large-eyed venerable Juno then answered:</p>
<p>“O earth-shaker! do thou thyself reflect within thy mind, with respect
to Æneas, whether thou wilt withdraw him, or suffer him, being brave, to
be subdued by Achilles, the son of Peleus. For already we two, I and
Pallas Minerva, have sworn many oaths amongst all the immortals, that we
will never help to avert the evil day from the Trojans, not even when
all Troy, fired, shall burn with consuming flame, and the warlike sons
of the Greeks fire it.”</p>
<p>But when earth-shaking Neptune heard this, he hastened to go through the
battle and the clash of spears; and came where were Æneas and renowned
Achilles. And immediately he shed a darkness upon the eyes of Achilles,
son of Peleus, and he drew out the ashen spear, well guarded with brass,
from the shield of magnanimous Æneas; and laid it before the feet of
Achilles, and pushed on Æneas, lifting him high up from the ground. But
Æneas leaped over many ranks of men and many of horses, impelled by the
hand of the god, and came to the rear of the troubled fight, where the
Caucones were arrayed for war. But very near him came earth-shaking
Neptune, and addressing him, spoke winged words:</p>
<p>“O Æneas, which of the gods commanded thee, thus mad, to combat against
Achilles, who is at once more valiant than thou, and more dear to the
immortals? But retire whenever thou shalt be opposed to him, lest, even
contrary to fate, thou arrive at the habitation of Pluto. But when
Achilles shall have attained his death and destiny, then again, being
confident, fight among the front ranks, because no other of the Greeks
shall slay thee.”</p>
<p>So saying, he left him there, when he had told him all, and immediately
afterwards dissipated the thick darkness from the eyes of Achilles, and
he then saw very clearly with his eyes; whereupon groaning, he addressed
his magnanimous soul:</p>
<p>“Ye gods! certainly I behold this, a great marvel with mine eyes. The
spear indeed lies upon the ground, nor do I at all perceive the man at
whom I hurled it, desiring to kill him. Undoubtedly Æneas, too, was dear
to the immortal gods, although I supposed that he boasted thus idly. Let
him go; there will be no spirit in him hereafter to make trial of me,
who even now rejoicing, has escaped from death. But come, having
encouraged the warlike Greeks, I will make trial of the other Trojans,
going against them.”</p>
<p>He spoke, and sprang into the ranks, and cheered on every man:</p>
<p>“No longer now stand off from the Trojans, O noble Greeks, but on! let
man advance against man, and let him be eager to engage. Difficult is it
for me, although being valiant, to attack so many warriors, and to fight
with them all. Not even Mars, who is an immortal god, nor yet Minerva,
could charge and toil against the force of such a conflict. Yet whatever
I can do with hands, with feet, and with strength, I declare that I will
no longer be remiss, not ever so little; but I will go right through
their line, nor do I think that any Trojan will rejoice, whoever may
come near my javelin.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, encouraging them; but illustrious Hector, upbraiding,
animated the Trojans, and said that he would go against Achilles:</p>
<p>“Ye magnanimous Trojans, fear not the son of Peleus. I, too, could fight
with words even with the immortals, but with the spear it is difficult,
for they are far more powerful. Nor shall Achilles give effect to all
his words; but one part he shall fulfil, and the other leave half
imperfect. Against him will I go, even though he were like to fire as to
his hands; and to shining iron, as to his might.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, inciting them; but the Trojans opposite quickly raised
their spears; their strength was mingled together, and a shout arose.
Then also Phœbus Apollo, standing near, addressed Hector:</p>
<p>“Hector, do not at all fight in the van with Achilles, but receive him
in the crowd, and from the tumult, lest by any chance he hit thee, or
strike thee with the sword in close combat.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, and Hector sunk back again into the thick body of men,
dismayed when he heard the voice of the god speaking. But Achilles
leaped among the Trojans, clad with courage as to his soul, shouting
dreadfully; and first slew gallant Iphition, son of Otrynteus, the
leader of many people, whom the nymph Naïs bore to Otrynteus, the sacker
of cities, under snowy Tmolus, in the rich district of Hyda.<span id="footnotetag664"/>

eagerly rushing straight forward, noble Achilles struck with his
javelin in the middle of the head; and it was entirely split in two. He
gave a crash as he fell, and noble Achilles boasted over him:</p>

paternal land, beside fishy Hyllus, and eddying Hermus.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, boasting; but darkness covered his (Iphition’s) eyes, but
the horses of the Greeks tore him with the tires of the wheels in the
front ranks. After him Achilles smote Demoleon, son of Antenor, a brave
repeller of the fight, in the temples, through his brazen-cheeked
helmet. Nor indeed did the brazen casque resist it, but through it the
eager javelin broke the bone, and the whole brain within was defiled;
and he subdued him, ardent. Next he wounded with his spear in the back,
Hippodamas, as he was leaping down from his chariot, while flying before
him. But he breathed out his soul, and groaned, like as when a bull,

fight, because he was the youngest among all, and dearest to him, and
surpassed all in speed. Then, indeed, through youthful folly, exhibiting
the excellence of his speed, he ran among the front ranks till he lost
his life. Him noble swift-footed Achilles smote rushing by, in the
middle of the back, where the golden rings of his belt clasped together,
and the doubled corslet met. Right through at the navel pierced the
point of the spear, and uttering a groan, he fell upon his knees; a
black cloud enveloped him, and stooping down, he gathered his intestines
in his hands. But when Hector perceived his brother Polydorus holding
his intestines in his hands, and rolled on the earth, a darkness was
immediately poured over his eyes, nor could he any longer be employed
afar off, but advanced towards Achilles, like unto a flame, brandishing
his sharp spear. On the other hand, Achilles, as soon as he saw him,
leaped up, and boasting, spoke:</p>

companion; no longer indeed let us dread each other through the

<p>He spoke, and sternly regarding [him], addressed noble Hector:</p>
<p>“Come nearer, that thou mayest the sooner reach the end of death.”</p>
<p>But him, not daunted, crest-tossing Hector addressed:</p>
<p>“O son of Peleus, do not expect to terrify me now like a little boy, at
least with words; since I myself also well know how to speak both
revilings and reproaches. I know that thou indeed art brave, and that I
am inferior to thee. But these things indeed are placed at the knees of
the gods, whether, although being inferior, I shall take away thy life,
striking thee with my spear, since my weapon also is sharp at the
point.”</p>
<p>He spoke, and, brandishing, sent forth his spear; and Minerva with a
breath turned it back from glorious Achilles, having breathed very
gently; but it came back to noble Hector, and lay before his feet. But
Achilles, eager to slay him, rushed furiously on, shouting dreadfully;
but Apollo, as a god, very easily snatched him away, and covered him
with abundant haze. Thrice indeed swift-footed noble Achilles rushed on
with his brazen spear, and thrice he smote the deep haze. But when he
rushed on the fourth time, like unto a god, he, dreadfully chiding,
addressed to him winged words:</p>
<p>“Dog, now again hast thou escaped death. Assuredly evil came very near
thee, but Phœbus Apollo has now again preserved thee, to whom thou art
wont to pray, when going into the clang of spears. Yet will I certainly
finish thee, meeting thee hereafter, if indeed any of the gods be an
ally to me also. At present, however, I will go after others of the
Trojans, whomsoever I can.”</p>
<p>So saying, he struck Dryops with his spear in the middle of the neck,
and he fell before his feet. Him then he left, and then detained
Demuchus, son of Philetor, brave and great, wounding [him] in the knee,
with his spear, whom then striking with his great sword, he deprived of
life. But attacking both, he pushed Laogonus and Dardanus, the sons of
Bias, from their chariot to the ground, wounding one with his spear, and
striking the other in close combat with his sword. Also Tros, the son of
Alastor, who came towards him, taking him by the knees, if on any terms
he would spare him, and dismiss him alive, nor slay him, taking pity on
their equal age: fool! who knew not that he would not be persuaded. For
he was by no means a tender-minded nor gentle man, but very ferocious.
He (Tros) indeed clasped his knees with his hands, desiring to
supplicate him, but he (Achilles) wounded him in the liver with his
sword; and his liver fell out, and the black blood from it filled his
bosom, and darkness veiled his eyes, wanting life. But standing near
Mulius, he smote him with his javelin on the ear, and immediately the
brazen blade went through the other ear. Then, with his large-hilted
sword, he smote Echeclus, son of Antenor, in the centre of the head, and
the whole sword became tepid with blood; but purple Death and violent
Fate seized his eyes. Then Deucalion, where the tendons of the elbow
unite, there he pierced him through his hand with his brazen spear; but
he, weighed down as to his hand, awaited him, perceiving death before
him. But he (Achilles) smiting his neck with his sword, knocked the head
off afar with its helmet, and the marrow sprang forth from the spine;
and Deucalion lay extended on the ground. Then he hastened to go towards
Rigmus, the renowned son of Pireus, who had come from fertile Thrace;
whom he smote in the middle with his javelin, and the brass was fixed in
his stomach; and he fell from his chariot: and Achilles wounded in the
back, with his sharp javelin, Areïthoüs, the attendant, while turning
back the steeds, and threw him from the chariot: and the horses were
thrown into confusion. And as the blazing fire burns through the deep
dells of a dry mountain, and the dense forest is consumed, and the wind
agitating, turns round the flame on all sides; thus he raged in every
direction with his spear, like unto a deity, following those that were
to be slain; and the black earth flowed with blood. As when any one
yokes broad fore-headed bulls to trample out white barley on the
well-levelled floor, and it easily becomes small beneath the feet of the
bellowing oxen; so the solid-hoofed horses, driven by magnanimous
Achilles, trod down together both corses and shields. And the whole
axletree beneath was polluted with gore, and the rings which were round
the chariot seat, which the drops from the horses’ hoofs spattered, as
well as from the felloes. But the son of Peleus was eager to bear away
glory, and was polluted with gore as to his invincible hands.</p>
