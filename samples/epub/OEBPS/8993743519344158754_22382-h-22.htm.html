<h2>BOOK THE TWENTY-SECOND.</h2>
<h4 id="pgepubid00050">ARGUMENT.</h4>
<p>Hector persists in remaining outside the walls, despite the entreaties
of his father. He flies thrice round Troy, fights, and is slain by
Achilles, who drags his body to the fleet at the wheels of his chariot.
The lamentations of his wife and parents follow.</p>
<p class="p2">
Thus they, indeed, driven by fright through the city, like fawns, were
refreshing themselves from sweat, and were drinking and allaying their
thirst, leaning against the handsome battlements; but the Greeks were
coming near the wall, resting their shields upon their shoulders. But
Hector his destructive fate fettered to remain there, before Ilium and
the Scæan gates. And Phœbus Apollo thus addressed the son of Peleus:</p>
<p>“Why, O son of Peleus, dost thou pursue me, an immortal god, with swift
feet, thyself being a mortal? Nor yet hast thou at all discovered that I
am a god; but thou incessantly ragest. For certainly the labour of the
Trojans is not now a care to thee, whom thou hast routed, and who are
now enclosed within their city, while thou art turned aside hither.
Neither canst thou slay me, since I am not mortal.”</p>
<p>But him swift-footed Achilles, greatly indignant,<span id="footnotetag695"/>

<p>“Thou hast injured me, O Far-darter, most destructive of all gods,
having now turned me away hither from the wall; certainly many had now
seized the earth with their teeth, before they had arrived at Ilium. But
now hast thou deprived me of great glory, and hast preserved them
easily, for thou didst not at all dread vengeance after. Certainly I
would punish thee, if the power at least were mine.”</p>
<p>Thus saying, he went towards the city greatly elate, hastening like a
steed which bears away the prize, with his chariot, which striving hard,
runs swiftly over the plain. So Achilles briskly moved his feet and his
knees.</p>
<p>But him aged Priam first beheld with his eyes, rushing over the plain,
all shining like a star which rises in autumn; and its resplendent rays
shine among many stars in the depth of the night, which by name they
call the dog of Orion. Very bright indeed is this, but it is a baleful
sign, and brings violent heat upon miserable mortals. So shone the brass
round the breast of him running. But the old man groaned, and smote his
head with his hands, raising them on high,<span id="footnotetag696"/>

out greatly, supplicating his dear son. But he stood before the Scæan
gates, insatiably eager to fight with Achilles; but the old man
piteously addressed him, stretching out his hands:</p>

<p>“O Hector, do not, my beloved son, await this man alone, without others;
lest that thou shouldst speedily draw on fate, subdued by the son of
Peleus; since he is much more powerful. Cruel! would that he were [only]
as dear to the gods as he is to me; quickly then would the dogs and
vultures devour him lying low; surely sad grief would then depart from
my heart. He who has made me deprived of many and brave sons, slaying,
and selling them into far-distant islands. For even now the Trojans
being shut up in the city, I cannot see my two sons, Lycaon and
Polydorus, whom Laothoë bore to me, queen among women. But if indeed
they live at the camp, surely we will afterwards redeem them with brass
and with gold; for it is within; for aged Altes, renowned by fame, gave
many things to his daughter. But if they are already dead, and in the
mansions of Hades, grief will be to my soul, and to their mother, we who
gave them birth. But to the other people the grief will be shorter, if
thou shouldst not die, subdued by Achilles. But come inside the wall, O
my son, that thou mayest save the Trojan men and women, nor afford great
glory to the son of Peleus, and thou thyself be deprived of thy dear
life. Moreover, pity me, wretched, yet still preserving my senses,<span id="footnotetag697"/>

<p>The old man spoke, and tore out the hoary locks with his hands, plucking
them from his head; nor did he persuade the mind of Hector. But his
mother, then on the other side, wailing, shed tears, laying bare her
bosom, whilst with the other hand she laid forth her breast; and
shedding tears, addressed to him winged words: “Ο Hector, my son,
reverence these things, and pity me myself. If ever I afforded thee the
grief-lulling breast, remember these things, O dear son; and being
within the wall, repel [this] hostile man; nor stand a foremost
adversary to him. Wretched one! for if he shall slay thee, neither shall
I mourn thee on the couch, my dear offspring, whom I myself brought
forth, nor will thy rich-dowered wife; but far away from us both, the
swift dogs will devour thee at the ships of the Greeks.”</p>
<p>Thus weeping, they twain addressed their dear son, supplicating him
much; nor did they persuade the mind of Hector; but he awaited huge
Achilles, coming near. And as a fierce serpent at its den, fed on evil

horribly, coiling itself around its den; so Hector, possessing
inextinguishable courage, retired not, leaning his splendid shield
against a projecting tower; but, indignant, he thus addressed his own
great-hearted soul:<span id="footnotetag701"/>

<p>“Ah me, if indeed I enter the gates and the wall, Polydamas will first

towards the city in this disastrous night, when noble Achilles arose to
battle. But I did not obey; certainly it would have been much better.
And now, since by my injurious obstinacy I have destroyed the people, I
fear the Trojan men, and the long-robed Trojan women, lest some one
inferior to me should say, ‘Hector, relying on his own strength, has
destroyed the people.’ Thus will they say; but it would have been far
better for me, slaying Achilles in the encounter,<span id="footnotetag703"/>

gloriously to be slain by him for the city. But if now I shall lay down
my bossed shield and stout helmet, and, resting my spear against the
wall, I myself going, shall come before renowned Achilles, and promise
that we will give to the Atrides to lead away Helen, and all the
numerous possessions along with her, whatever Paris brought to Troy in
his hollow barks, and who was the origin of the contention, and at the
same time that we will divide others, as many as this city contains,
among the Greeks,—but again I should exact an oath from the elders of
the Trojans,<span id="footnotetag704"/>

into two portions, whatever treasure this delightful city contains
within it. Yet why does my soul discuss such things? [I dread] lest I,
going, should reach him, but he pity me not, nor at all respect me, but
slay me, being thus naked, as a woman, after I have put off my armour.
Nor, indeed, is it now allowed to converse with him from an oak, or from
a rock, as a virgin and a youth; a virgin and youth converse with one
another. But it is better to engage him in strife; that as soon as
possible we may know to which, indeed, the Olympian [Jove] will give
glory.”</p>

<p>Thus he pondered, remaining; but near him came Achilles, like unto the
helmet-shaking warrior, Mars, brandishing upon his right shoulder the
dreadful Pelian ash; but the brass shone around, like unto the splendour
either of a blazing fire, or of the rising sun. Then, as tremor seized
Hector, he perceived him, nor could he remain there any longer, but he
left the gates behind him, and fled affrighted; but the son of Peleus
rushed on, trusting to his swift feet. As a falcon in the mountains, the
swiftest of birds, easily dashes after a timid pigeon; she, indeed,
flies away obliquely; but he, close at hand, shrilly screaming,
frequently assails, and his spirit orders him to seize her: thus, eager,
he flew right on; but Hector fled in terror under the wall of the
Trojans, and moved his fleet limbs. Then they rushed by the
prospect-ground and the wind-waving fig-tree, always under the wall
along the public way, and reached the two fair-flowing springs, where
the two springs of the eddying Scamander rise. The one, indeed, flows
with tepid water, and a steam arises from it around, as of burning fire;
whilst the other flows forth in the summer time, like unto hail, or cold
snow, or ice from water. There, at them, are the wide, handsome stone
basins, where the wives and fair daughters of the Trojans used to wash
their splendid garments formerly in time of peace, before the sons of
the Greeks arrived. In this direction they ran past [the one] flying,
but the other pursuing from behind. A brave man, indeed, fled before,
but a much braver swiftly pursued him; since they did not seek to obtain
a victim or a bull’s hide, such as are the rewards of men for speed, but
they ran for the life of horse-breaking Hector. And as when
prize-winning<span id="footnotetag705"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-22.htm.html#footnote705" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">705</sup></a> solid-hoofed steeds ran very swiftly round the
course, and a great reward is proposed, either a tripod, or a woman [in
honour] of a deceased hero; so they thrice made the circuit of the city
of Priam with their swift feet: and all the gods beheld. Then to them
the father of men and gods commenced an address:</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote705"/><b>Footnote 705:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-22.htm.html#footnotetag705" class="pginternal">
(return) </a> <i>I.e.</i> race horses.</p>
<p>“Alas! certainly I behold with mine eyes a beloved hero pursued round
the wall; and my heart is grieved on account of Hector, who has
sacrificed many thighs of oxen to me, upon the tops of many-valed Ida,
and at other times again in the highest [places of] the city; but now,
indeed, noble Achilles pursues him, on swift feet, around the city of
Priam. But come, deliberate, O ye gods, and consider, whether we shall
preserve him from death, or shall subdue him now, being brave [at the
hands of] Achilles, the son of Peleus.”</p>
<p>But him the blue-eyed goddess Minerva then addressed:</p>
<p>“O father, hurler of the white thunder, [collector] of dark clouds, what
a word hast thou spoken! Dost thou wish to liberate from sad death a
man, being mortal, long ago destined to fate? Do it: but all we, the
other gods, will not assent to thee.”</p>
<p>Her, then, the cloud-compelling Jupiter, answering, addressed: “Take
courage, Tritonia, beloved child: I by no means speak with serious mind,
but I wish to be mild to thee. Do as is the inclination, nor delay at
all.”</p>
<p>Thus speaking, he incited Minerva, already prepared; and, springing
forth, she descended down from the heights of Olympus.</p>
<p>But swift Achilles pursued Hector, incessantly pressing upon him. And as
when a dog pursues the fawn of a deer in the mountains, having roused it
from its lair, through both glens and thickets; and, although
panic-stricken, it crouches down beneath a brake; yet tracking it, he
runs continually on until he finds it; so Hector eluded not the
swift-footed son of Peleus. As often as he would rush against the
Dardanian gates, towards under the well-built towers, if perchance they
might aid him with missile weapons from above, so often, previously
anticipating him, he turned him away towards the plain; whilst he
himself always flew on the side of the city. And as in a dream one
cannot pursue a fugitive; neither can the one escape the other, nor the
other pursue: so the one could not overtake the other in his speed, nor
the other escape him. But how, then, could Hector have escaped the fates
of death, if Apollo had not, for the very last time, met him, who
aroused for him his courage and swift knees? But noble Achilles nodded
to the people with his head, nor permitted them to cast their bitter
weapons at Hector, lest some one, wounding him, should obtain the glory,
and he himself come second. But when for the fourth time they arrived at
the fountains, then, indeed, the Sire raised aloft his golden scales,
and placed in them the two fates of death, bearing long sleep, this of
Achilles, but that of horse-breaking Hector. Holding them by the middle,
he poised them, and the fatal day of Hector inclined and sunk to Hades;
but Phœbus Apollo left him.</p>
<p>Then the blue-eyed goddess Minerva approached the son of Peleus, and,
standing near, addressed to him winged words:</p>
<p>“Now, O illustrious Achilles, dear to Jove, I hope that we two shall
bear back great glory to the Greeks at the ships, having slain Hector,
although being insatiate of war. Now, certainly, it is no longer
possible for him to escape us, not even if far-darting Apollo should
toil much, throwing himself at the feet of the ægis-bearing father Jove.
But do thou now stand and revive; but I, approaching with thee, will
persuade him to engage thee face to face.”</p>
<p>Thus spoke Minerva; but he obeyed, and rejoiced in his mind; and stood,
leaning upon his ashen, brass-pointed spear. But she then left him, and
overtook noble Hector, likening herself to Deïphobus, unwearied in her
body and voice; and, standing near, she addressed to him winged words:
“O brother dear, certainly swift Achilles now greatly presses on thee,
pursuing thee with rapid feet round the city of Priam. But come now, let
us stand, and, awaiting, repulse him.”</p>
<p>But her mighty crest-tossing Hector in turn addressed:</p>
<p>“Deïphobus, surely thou wert ever before by far the dearest to me of my
brothers, the sons whom Hecuba and Priam produced. But now I think in my
mind that I honour thee still more, since thou hast dared for my sake,
when thou dost behold [me] with thine eyes, to come out of the city;
while others remain within.”</p>
<p>But him the azure-eyed goddess Minerva in turn addressed:</p>
<p>“My brother dear, my father and venerable mother indeed greatly
supplicated me, by turn embracing my knees and my companions around, to
remain there (so much do all tremble with fear); but my mind within was
harassed with sad grief. But now let us forthwith eagerly engage, nor
let there any longer be a sparing of our spears, that we may know
whether Achilles, having slain us both, shall bear our bloody spoils to
the hollow barks, or be subdued by thy spear.”</p>
<p>Thus having spoken, Minerva also with deception led on. But when they
were near advancing towards each other, him mighty crest-tossing Hector
first addressed:</p>
<p>“No longer, O son of Peleus, will I fly thee as before. Thrice have I
fled round the great city of Priam, nor ever dared to await thee coming
on; but now my mind urges me to stand against thee: certainly I shall
slay, or be slain. But come, let us attest the gods; for they will be
the best witnesses and observers of agreements. For neither will I
cruelly insult thee, if indeed Jove shall give me the victory, and I
take away thy life; but after I shall despoil thy beautiful armour, O
Achilles, I will give back thy body to the Greeks; and so also do thou.”</p>
<p>But him swift-footed Achilles sternly regarding, addressed:</p>
<p>“Talk not to me of covenants, O most cursed Hector. As there are not
faithful leagues between lions and men, nor yet have wolves and lambs an
according mind,<span id="footnotetag706"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-22.htm.html#footnote706" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">706</sup></a> but ever meditate evils against each other; so it
is not possible for thee and me to contract a friendship, nor shall
there at all be leagues between us,—first shall one, falling, satiate
the invincible warrior Mars with his blood. Call to mind all thy valour;
now it is very necessary for thee to be both a spearman and a daring
warrior. Nor is there any longer any escape for thee, for Pallas Minerva
at once subdues thee beneath my spear, and thou shalt now pay for all
the accumulated sorrows of my companions, whom thou hast slain, raging
with the spear.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote706"/><b>Footnote 706:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-22.htm.html#footnotetag706" class="pginternal">

<p>He spoke, and brandishing it, sent forth his long-shadowed spear, and
illustrious Hector, seeing it opposite, avoided it; for, looking before
him, he sunk down, and the brazen spear passed over him, and was fixed
in the earth. But Pallas Minerva plucked it out, and gave it back to
Achilles, and escaped the notice of Hector, the shepherd of the people.
Then Hector addressed the illustrious son of Peleus:</p>
<p>“Thou hast erred, O godlike Achilles, nor art thou yet acquainted with
my fate from Jove; certainly thou didst say so, but thou art a prater,
and very subtle in words, in order that, dreading thee, I may be
forgetful of my strength and courage. But not in my back, whilst flying,
shalt thou thrust thy spear, but shalt drive it through my breast,
rushing right on, if God grants this to thee. But now in turn avoid my
brazen spear! would that thou mightst now receive it all in thy body.
Then truly would the war become lighter to the Trojans, thou being
slain; for thou art the greatest bane to them.”</p>
<p>He spoke, and, brandishing, sent forth his long-shadowed spear, and
struck the centre of Pelides’ shield, nor missed; but the spear was
repelled far away from the shield. But Hector was enraged because his
swift weapon had fled in vain from his hand; and stood dejected, for he
had not another ashen spear. Then he called upon the white-shielded
Deïphobus, greatly shouting, [and] he asked him for a long spear; but he
was not near him; and Hector perceived in his mind, and said:</p>
<p>“Alas! without doubt, now the gods have summoned me to death. For I
indeed thought the hero Deïphobus was by my side; but he is within the
wall, and Minerva has deceived me. But now is evil death near me, nor
far away, neither is there escape. Certainly this long since was more
agreeable to Jove and to the far-darting son of Jove, who formerly,
propitious, preserved me; but now, on the contrary, Fate overtakes me.
Nevertheless I will not perish cowardly and ingloriously at least, but
having done some great deed to be heard of even by posterity.”</p>
<p>Thus having spoken, he drew his sharp sword, which hung below his loins,
both huge and strong, and, with collected might, rushed forward, like a
lofty-soaring eagle, which swoops to the plain through the gloomy
clouds, about to snatch either a tender lamb, or a timid hare; thus
Hector rushed forward, brandishing his sharp sword. Achilles also rushed
on, and filled his soul with fierce rage. He sheltered his breast in
front with his shield, beautiful, curiously wrought and nodded with his
shining helmet, four-coned; but the beautiful golden tufts, which Vulcan
had diffused in great abundance round the cone, were shaken. As the star
Hesperus, which is placed the brightest star in heaven,<span id="footnotetag707"/>

amongst other stars in the unseasonable time of night, so it shone from
the well-sharpened spear which Achilles, designing mischief to noble
Hector, brandished in his right hand, eyeing his fair person, where it
would best yield. But the beautiful brazen armour, of which he had
despoiled great Patroclus, having slain him, covered the rest of his
body so much; yet did there appear [a part] where the collar-bones
separate the neck from the shoulders, and where the destruction of life
is most speedy. There noble Achilles, eager, drove into him with the
spear, and the point went out quite through his tender neck. However the
ash, heavy with brass, did not cut away the windpipe, so that, answering
in words, he could address him. But he fell in the dust, and noble
Achilles vaunted over him:</p>
<p>“Hector, thou didst once suppose, when spoiling Patroclus, that thou be
safe, nor dreaded me, being absent. Fool! for I apart, a much braver
avenger of him, was left behind at the hollow ships, I who have relaxed

but the Greeks shall perform his funeral rites.”</p>
<p>But him crest-tossing Hector, growing languid, then addressed:</p>
<p>“I supplicate thee by thy soul, thy knees, thy parents, suffer not the
dogs to tear me at the ships of the Greeks; but do thou indeed receive
brass in abundance, and gold, which my father and venerable mother will
give thee; and send my body home, that the Trojans and wives of the
Trojans may make me, dead, partaker of a funeral pyre.” <span id="footnotetag708"/>

<p>“Dog, supplicate me not by my knees, nor by my parents; for would that
my might and mind in any manner urge me myself, tearing thy raw flesh to
pieces, to devour it, such things hast thou done to me. So that there is
not any one who can drive away the dogs from thy head, not even if they
should place ten-fold and twenty-times such ransoms, bringing them
hither, and even promise others; not even if Dardanian Priam should wish
to compensate for thee with gold:<span id="footnotetag709"/>

mother lament [thee] whom she has borne, having laid thee upon a bier,
but dogs and fowl shall entirely tear thee in pieces.”</p>
<p>But him crest-tossing Hector, dying, addressed:</p>
<p>“Surely well knowing thee, I foresaw this, nor was I destined to
persuade thee; for truly within thee there is an iron soul. Reflect now,
lest to thee I be some cause of the wrath of the gods, on that day when

Scæan gates.”</p>
<p>As he spoke thus, the end of death overshadowed him; and his soul flying
from his limbs, descended to Hades, bewailing its destiny, relinquishing
vigour and youth. But him, although dead, noble Achilles addressed:</p>
<p>“Die: but I will then receive my fate whensoever Jove may please to
accomplish it,<span id="footnotetag711"/>

<p>He spoke, and plucked the spear from the corpse; and then laid it aside,
but he spoiled the bloody armour from his shoulders. But the other sons
of the Greeks ran round, who also admired the stature and wondrous form,
of Hector;<span id="footnotetag712"/>

<p>Thus would some one say, and, standing by, would wound him. But
swift-footed Achilles, after he had despoiled him, standing amongst the
Greeks, spoke winged words:</p>
<p>“O friends, leaders and princes of the Greeks, since the gods have
granted us to subdue this hero, he who did as many mischiefs, as did not
all the others together; come! let us make trial round the city with our
arms, that we may learn concerning the Trojans, what mind they have;
whether they are about to desert the citadel, he being slain, or intend
to remain, Hector being no more. But why does my mind within me
deliberate these things? Patroclus lies at the ships, an unwept,
unburied corse; and him I shall never forget, as long as I am amongst
the living, and my dear knees move for me; and though they forget the
dead in Hades, yet will I remember my beloved comrade even there. But

the hollow ships, and let us bring him; we bear back great glory: we
have slain noble Hector, whom the Trojans, throughout the city,
worshipped as a god.”</p>
<p>He spoke, and was meditating unseemly deeds against noble Hector. He
perforated the tendons of both his feet behind, from the heel to the
instep, and fastened in them leather thongs, and bound him from the
chariot; but left his head to be trailed along. Then ascending his
chariot, and taking up the splendid armour, he lashed (the horses) to go
on, and they, not unwilling, flew. But the dust arose from him while
trailed along, and his azure locks around approached [the ground],<span id="footnotetag714"/>

and his entire head, once graceful, lay in the dust; for Jupiter had
then granted to his enemies, to dishonour him in his own father-land.
Thus indeed his whole head was defiled with dust; but his mother plucked
out her hair, and cast away her shining veil, and wept very loudly,
having beheld her son. And his dear father groaned piteously, and all
the people around were occupied in wailing and lamentation through the
city; and it was very like to this, as if all Ilium, from its summit,
were smouldering in fire. With difficulty indeed did the people detain
the old man, indignant with grief anxious to rush out from the Dardanian
gates: for rolling in the mud, he was supplicating all, addressing each
man by name:</p>

<p>“Desist, my friends, and permit me alone, grieved as I am, going out of
the city, to approach the ships of the Greeks. I will supplicate this
reckless, violent man, if perchance he may respect my time of life, and
have compassion on my old age; for such is his father Peleus to him, he
who begat and nurtured him a destruction to the Trojans; but
particularly to me above all has he caused sorrows. For so many blooming

thus we should have been satisfied, weeping and lamenting, both his

the citizens also groaned. But among the Trojan dames, Hecuba began her
continued lamentation:</p>

and an advantage to the Trojan men and women throughout the city, who
received thee as a god. For assuredly thou wast a very great glory to
them when alive now, on the contrary, death and fate possess thee.”</p>
<p>Thus she spoke, weeping; but the wife of Hector had not yet learned
anything: no certain messenger going, informed her that her husband had
remained without the gates; but she was weaving a web in a retired part
of her lofty house; double, splendid, and was spreading on it various
painted works.<span id="footnotetag716"/>

by the hands of Achilles. But she heard the shriek and wailing from the
tower, and her limbs were shaken, and the shuttle fell from her to the
ground; and immediately she addressed her fair-haired attendants:</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote716"/><b>Footnote 716:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-22.htm.html#footnotetag716" class="pginternal">

<p>“Come hither, let two follow me, that I may see what deeds have been
done. I heard the voice of my venerable mother-in-law, and to myself the
heart within my breast leaps up to my mouth, and the limbs under me are
benumbed. Surely some evil is now near the sons of Priam. O that the
word may be [far] from my ear! I dread lest brave Achilles, having
already cut off noble Hector alone from the city, may drive him towards
the plain, and even now have made him desist from the fatal valour which
possessed him; for he never remained among the throng of warriors, but
leaped out far before, yielding in his valour to none.”</p>
<p>Thus having spoken, she rushed through the palace like unto one
deranged, greatly palpitating in heart; and her attendants went along
with her. But when she reached the tower and the crowd of men, she stood
looking round over the wall, and beheld him dragged before the city; but
the fleet steeds drew him ruthlessly towards the ships of the Greeks.
Then gloomy night veiled her over her eyes, and she fell backwards, and
breathed out her soul in a swoon. But from her head fell the beautiful
head-gear, the garland, the net, and the twisted fillet, and the veil
which golden Venus had given to her on that day when crest-tossing
Hector led her from the palace of Eëtion, after he had presented many
marriage-gifts. Around her in great numbers stood her sisters-in-law and
sisters, who supported her amongst them, seized with stupor unto
death.<span id="footnotetag717"/>

<p>“Hector, O wretched me! then we were both born to a like fate, thou
indeed in Troy, in the mansion of Priam, but I in Thebe, beneath woody
Placus, in the palace of Eëtion; who, himself ill-fated, reared me,
ill-fated, being yet a little child;—would that he had not begotten me!
Now, however, thou goest to the mansions of Hades beneath the recesses
of the earth, but leavest me, in hateful grief, a widow in the dwelling;
and thy boy, yet such an infant, to whom thou and I unfortunate gave
birth; nor wilt thou be an advantage to him, O Hector, for thou art
dead; nor he to thee. For even if he shall escape the mournful war of
the Greeks, still will labour and hardship ever be to him hereafter;
for others will deprive him of his fields by changing the landmarks. But
the bereaving day renders a boy destitute of his contemporaries; he is
ever dejected, and his cheeks are bedewed with tears. The boy in want
shall go to the companions of his father, pulling one by the cloak,
another by the tunic; and some of these pitying, shall present him with
a very small cup; and he shall moisten his lips, but not wet his palate.

the banquet, striking him with his hands, and reviling him with
reproaches: ‘A murrain on thee! even thy father feasts not with us.’
Then shall the boy Astyanax return weeping to his widowed mother,—he
who formerly, indeed, upon the knees of his own father, ate marrow
alone, and the rich fat of sheep; but when sleep came upon him, and he
ceased childishly crying, used to sleep on couches in the arms of a
nurse, in a soft bed, full as to his heart with delicacies. But now,
indeed, Astyanax,<span id="footnotetag719"/>

graceful, woven by the hands of women, lie in thy palaces. Truly all
these will I consume with burning fire, being of no use to thee, for
thou wilt not lie on them; but let them be a glory [to thee] before the
Trojans and the Trojan dames.”</p>
