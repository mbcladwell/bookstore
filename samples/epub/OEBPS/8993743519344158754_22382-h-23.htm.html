<h2>BOOK THE TWENTY-THIRD.</h2>
<h4 id="pgepubid00052">ARGUMENT.</h4>
<p>Achilles, admonished in a dream by the ghost of his friend, celebrates
the funeral of Patroclus.</p>
<p class="p2">
Thus they indeed were mourning through the city; but the Greeks, as soon
as they reached the ships and the Hellespont, were separated each to his
own ship. But Achilles did not permit the Myrmidons to be dispersed, but
he spoke amongst his warlike companions [thus]:</p>
<p>“Ye swift-horsed Myrmidons, comrades dear to me, let us not yet loose
the solid-hoofed steeds from under our chariots, but with the very
horses and chariots, going near, let us bewail Patroclus; for this is
the honour of the dead. But when we have indulged<span id="footnotetag720"/>

unyoking our steeds, we will all sup here.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but they mourned in a body; and Achilles led the way.
Thrice they drove their fair-maned steeds around the body,<span id="footnotetag721"/>

grieving; and among them Thetis kindled a longing for lamentation.
Moistened were the sands, and moistened were the arms of the men with
tears; for so brave a master of the flight they longed. But among them
the son of Peleus led the abundant lamentation, laying his
man-slaughtering hands upon the breast of his companion:</p>

   <i>decursio</i>. Cf. Liv. xxv. 17: Tacit. Ann. ii. 7; Sueton. Claud. §
   i. According to Plutarch, Alexander the Great performed the same
   honours at the tomb of Achilles, that Achilles had bestowed upon
   the manes of his friend Patroclus. See also Bernart on Stat.

<p>“Hail! O Patroclus, even in the dwellings of Hades; for now shall I
accomplish all those things which formerly I promised, that having
dragged Hector hither, I would give him to the dogs to be devoured raw;
and that before thy pile I would cut the necks of twelve illustrious
sons of the Trojans, enraged on account of thee slain.”</p>
<p>He spoke, and meditated unworthy deeds against noble Hector, having
stretched him prone in the dust before the bier of Menœtiades; but they
each stripped off his brazen, glittering armour, and unyoked their
high-sounding steeds. They sat also in crowds at the ship of
swift-footed Æacides; but he afforded to them an agreeable funeral
feast.<span id="footnotetag722"/>

having their throats cut, and many sheep and bleating goats. Many
white-tusked swine also, abounding in fat, were extended for roasting in
the flame of Vulcan; and on every side around the dead body flowed
abundant blood. But the chiefs of the Greeks led the king, the
swift-footed son of Peleus, to noble Agamemnon, hardly persuading him
enraged at heart on account of his companion. But when advancing they
reached the tent of Agamemnon, he straightway ordered the clear-voiced
heralds to place a large tripod on the fire, if he could persuade the
son of Peleus to wash away the bloody gore. But he sternly refused, and
besides swore an oath:<span id="footnotetag724"/>

(return) </a> Buttm. Lexil. p. 436, after insisting strongly on
   the <i>personification</i> of Ὅρκος, observes on this passage: “I see
   no reason why we should not suppose that in the poet’s mind
   Jupiter was put in opposition to ὅρκον, exactly in the same sense
   as ὄρκος is actually found in opposition to Ζεύς in Pindar, Pyth.
   iv. 297. Κάρτερος ὅρκος ἄμμι μάρτυς ἔστω Ζεὺς ὁ γενέθλιος
   άμφοτέροις. Further, the expressions μέγας όρκος, κάρτερος ὅρκος
   suit much better the idea of the witness or pledge of the oath,
   than they do the oath itself.”</p>
<p>“No, by Jove, who is both the supreme and the best of gods, it is not
lawful that ablutions should come near my head, before I place Patroclus
on the pile, and have thrown up a mound, and shorn my hair; for not to
such a degree will sorrow a second time invade my heart, whilst I am
among the living. But nevertheless let us now yield to the loathsome
banquet. But on the morrow, Ο king of men, Agamemnon, give orders to
bring wood, and dispose it so as is proper that a dead body enjoying it,
should descend beneath the obscure darkness; so that the indefatigable
fire may consume him very quickly from our eyes, and the people may
return to their occupations.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but they indeed readily listened to him, and obeyed. Then
they, each sedulously preparing supper, feasted; nor did their mind lack
aught of an equal feast. But when they had dismissed the desire of food
and drink, some departed in order to lie down, each to his tent. But the
son of Peleus, on the contrary, amid his many Myrmidons, lay near the
shore of the far-sounding sea, heavily moaning, in a clear spot, where
the waves plashed against the shore; when sweet<span id="footnotetag725"/>

around, took possession of him, relaxing the cares of his mind; for he
was very much fatigued as to his fair knees, chasing Hector at
wind-swept Ilium. But to him came the spirit of wretched Patroclus, like
unto him in all things, as to bulk, and beautiful eyes, and his voice;
and like garments also were around his body; and he stood over his head,
and addressed him:</p>
<p>“Sleepest thou, O Achilles, and art thou forgetful of me? Thou didst not
indeed neglect me when alive, but [now that I am] dead. Bury me, that I
may as soon as possible pass the gates of Hades. The spirits, the images

thee, for I shall not again return from Hades after thou hast made me a
partaker of the fire. For by no means shall we, being alive, sitting
apart from our dear companions, deliberate counsels; but the hateful
fate which befel me when born, has snatched me away. And to thyself
also, O godlike Achilles, thy fate is to perish beneath the wall of the
noble Trojans. But another thing I bid, and will command, O Achilles, if
thou wilt obey, not to lay my bones apart from thine; but as we were
nurtured together in thy palaces, when Menœtius led me from Opus, a
little boy, to thy home, on account of a melancholy homicide, on that
day when, imprudent, I slew the son of Amphidamas, not wishing it,
enraged about the dice:<span id="footnotetag728"/>

<p>But him swift-footed Achilles, answering, addressed:</p>
<p>“Why, O venerable friend, hast thou come to me, and commandest each of
these things to me? Yet will I readily accomplish all these things for
thee, and obey as thou commandest. But stand nearer to me, that
embracing each other even for a little while, we may indulge in sad
lamentation.”</p>

caught him;<span id="footnotetag729"/>

like smoke. Then Achilles sprang up astonished, and clapped together his
hands, and spoke this doleful speech:</p>
<p>“Alas! there is indeed then, even in the dwellings of Hades, a certain
spirit and image, but there is no body<span id="footnotetag731"/>

<p>Thus he spoke; and excited among them all a longing for lamentation; and
rosy-fingered Morn appeared to them while weeping around the miserable
corpse. But king Agamemnon incited everywhere from the tents both mules
and men to bring wood; and for this a brave man was roused, Meriones,
the servant of valour-loving Idomeneus. And they went, holding in their
hands wood-lopping axes and well-twisted ropes; and before them went the
mules. They passed over many ascents,<span id="footnotetag732"/>

and crossways. But when they reached the forests of many-rilled Ida,
hastening, they cut down the towering oaks with the keen-edged brass.
These greatly resounding, fell; and the Greeks then splitting them, tied
[them] upon the mules, but they pained the ground with their hoofs,
eager to reach the plain through the close thickets. But all the
wood-cutters carried trunks of trees, for so Meriones, the servant of
valour-loving Idomeneus, ordered; and afterwards threw them in order
upon the shore, where Achilles designed a mighty tomb for Patroclus, and
for himself.</p>
<p>But when they had thrown on all sides immense quantities of wood,
remaining there in a body, they sat down; but Achilles immediately
ordered the warlike Myrmidons to gird on the brass, and to yoke each his
horses to his chariot; but they arose, and were arrayed in their armour.
And both the combatants and the charioteers ascended their chariots; the
cavalry indeed first, but a cloud of infantry followed after in myriads;
and in the midst his companions bore Patroclus. They covered all the
dead body over with hair, which, cutting off,<span id="footnotetag733"/>

but noble Achilles held his head behind, grieving, for he was sending a
blameless companion to Hades.</p>

<p>“In vain, O Sperchius, did my father Peleus vow to thee, that I,
returning to my dear native land, should there cut off my hair for thee,
and offer a sacred hecatomb; and besides, that I would in the same place
sacrifice fifty male sheep at the fountains, where are a grove and
fragrant altar to thee. Thus the old man spake, but thou hast not
fulfilled his will. And now, since I return not to my dear fatherland, I
will give my hair to the hero Patroclus, to be borne [with him].” Thus
saying, he placed his hair in the hands of his dear companion; and
excited amongst them all a longing for weeping. And the light of the sun
had certainly set upon them, mourning, had not Achilles, standing
beside, straightway addressed Agamemnon:</p>
<p>“O son of Atreus (for to thy words the people of the Greeks most
especially hearken), it is possible to satiate oneself even with

<p>“Hail! O Patroclus, even in the dwellings of Hades: for I now fulfil all
things which I formerly promised thee; twelve brave sons of the
magnanimous Trojans, all these, along with thee, shall the fire consume;
but I will not suffer Hector, the son of Priam, to be devoured by fire,
but by the dogs.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, threatening; but about him the dogs were not busied; for
Venus, the daughter of Jove, drove off the dogs both days and nights,
and anointed him with a rosy unguent, ambrosial, that he might not
lacerate him dragging him along. Over him also Phœbus Apollo drew a dark
cloud from heaven to the plain, and overshadowed the whole space, as
much as the dead body occupied, lest the influence of the sun should
previously dry the body all around, with the nerves and limbs.</p>
<p>Yet the pile of dead Patroclus burnt not. Then again noble Achilles
meditated other things. Standing apart from the pile, he prayed to two
winds, Boreas and Zephyrus, and promised fair sacrifices; and, pouring
out many libations with a golden goblet, he supplicated them to come,
that they might burn the body with fire as soon as possible, and the
wood might hasten to be burned. But swift Iris, hearing his prayers,
went as a messenger to the winds. They, indeed, together at home with
fierce-breathing Zephyrus, were celebrating a feast, when Iris,
hastening, stood upon the stone threshold. But when they beheld her with
their eyes, they rose up, and invited her to him, each of them. But she,
on the contrary, refused to sit down, and spoke [this] speech:</p>
<p>“No seat [for me]; for I return again to the flowings of the ocean, to
the land of the Æthiopians, where they sacrifice hecatombs to the
immortals, that now I, too, may have a share in their offerings. But
Achilles now supplicates Boreas, and sonorous Zephyrus, to come, that ye
may kindle the pile to be consumed, on which lies Patroclus, whom all
the Greeks bewail.”</p>
<p>She, indeed, thus having spoken, departed; but they hastened to go with
a great tumult, driving on the clouds before them. Immediately they
reached the sea, blowing, and the billow was raised up beneath their
sonorous blast: but they reached the very fertile Troad, and fell upon
the pile, and mightily resounded the fiercely-burning fire. All night,
indeed, did they together toss about the blaze of the pyre, shrilly
blowing; and all night swift Achilles, holding a double cup, poured wine
upon the ground, drawing it from a golden goblet, and moistened the
earth, invoking the manes of wretched Patroclus. And as a father mourns,
consuming the bones of his son, a bridegroom who, dying, has afflicted
his unhappy parents, so mourned Achilles, burning the bones of his
companion, pacing pensively beside the pile, groaning continually. But
when Lucifer arrived, proclaiming light over the earth, after whom
saffron-vested Morn is diffused over the sea, then the pyre grew
languid, and the flame decayed; and the Winds departed again, to return
home through the Thracian sea; but it (the sea) groaned indeed, raging
with swelling billow.</p>

him fell sweet sleep. The others, however, were assembling in crowds
round the son of Atreus, the noise and tumult of whom, approaching,
awoke him; and, being raised up, he sat, and addressed them:</p>

<p>“O son of Atreus, and ye other chiefs of the Greeks, first, indeed,
extinguish the whole pile, as much as the fire has seized, with dark
wine; and then let us collect the bones of Patroclus, the son of
Menœtius, well discriminating them (for they are readily distinguished;
for he lay in the centre of the pyre, but the others, both horses and
men, were burned promiscuously at the extremity), and let us place them
in a golden vessel, and with a double [layer of] fat, till I myself be
hidden in Hades. And I wish that a tomb should be made, not very large,

make it both broad and lofty, you who may be left behind me at the
many-benched barks.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; and they obeyed the swift-footed son of Peleus. First of
all, indeed, they totally extinguished the pyre with dark wine, as much
as the fire had invaded, and the deep ashes fell in; and, weeping, they
collected the white bones of their mild companion into a golden vessel,
and a double [layer of] fat; then, laying them in the tent, they covered
them with soft<span id="footnotetag742"/>

and laid the foundations around the pile; and immediately upraised a
mound of earth; and, heaping up the tomb, returned. But Achilles
detained the people there, and made the wide assembly sit down; but from
the ships he brought forth prizes, goblets, tripods, horses, mules, and
sturdy heads of oxen, and slender-waisted women, and hoary<span id="footnotetag743"/>

away, faultless, skilled in works, as well as a handled tripod of
two-and-twenty measures, for the first; but for the second he staked a

<p>“O son of Atreus, and ye other well-greaved Greeks, these prizes lie in
the circus, awaiting the charioteers. If now, indeed, in honour of
another, we Grecians were contending, then truly would I, receiving,
bear the first [prizes] to my tent. For ye know how much my steeds
surpass in excellence; for they are both immortal, and Neptune gave them
to my father Peleus, who, again, delivered them to me. But nevertheless
I and my solid-hoofed steeds will remain apart [from the contest];
because they have lost the excellent might of such a charioteer, who
very often poured the moist oil over their manes, having washed them
with limpid water. They, indeed, standing, lament him, but their manes
hang down upon the ground, and they stand, grieved at heart. However, do
ye others through the army prepare, whoever of the Greeks confides in
his steeds and well-fastened chariots.”</p>
<p>Thus spoke the son of Peleus; but the swift charioteers arose. But, far
the first, arose Eumelus, king of men, the dear son of Admetus, who
surpassed in equestrian skill. After him arose the son of Tydeus,
valiant Diomede, and led under the yoke the horses of Tros, which he
formerly took from Æneas; but Apollo preserved himself<span id="footnotetag745"/>

to whom arose the most noble son of yellow-haired Atreus, Menelaus, and
led beneath the yoke fleet steeds, Agamemnon’s mare Æthe, and his own
stallion, Podargus. Her Echepolus, the son of Anchises, had presented
as a gift to Agamemnon, that he need not follow him to wind-swept Ilium,
but staying there might be delighted; for Jove had given him great
wealth, and he dwelt in wise Sicyon. Her, persevering in the race, he
led under the yoke. But Antilochus, the fourth, harnessed his
beautiful-maned steeds (the illustrious son of the magnanimous king
Nestor, the son of Neleus), and swift-footed Pelian-born steeds drew his
chariot for him; but his father, standing near, spoke for his good,
advising him, though himself prudent:</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote745"/><b>Footnote 745:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-23.htm.html#footnotetag745" class="pginternal">
(return) </a> Æneas.</p>
<p>“O Antilochus, assuredly indeed both Jove and Neptune have loved thee,
although being young, and have taught thee all kinds of equestrian
exercise; wherefore there is no great need to instruct thee. For thou
knowest how to turn the goals with safety; but thy horses are very slow
to run, wherefore I think that disasters may happen. Their horses,
indeed, are more fleet, but they themselves know not how to manoeuvre
better than thou thyself. But come now, beloved one, contrive every
manner of contrivance in thy mind, lest the prizes by any chance escape
thee. By skill is the wood-cutter much better than by strength; and,
again, by skill the pilot directs upon the dark sea the swift ship,
tossed about by the winds; and by skill charioteer excels charioteer.
One man who is confident in his steeds and chariot, turns imprudently
hither and thither over much [ground], and his steeds wander through the
course, nor does he rein them in. But he, on the contrary, who is
acquainted with stratagem [though] driving inferior steeds, always
looking at the goal, turns it close, nor does it escape him in what
manner he may first turn [the course]<span id="footnotetag746"/>

he holds on steadily, and watches the one who is before him. But I will
show thee the goal, easily distinguished, nor shall it escape thy
notice. A piece of dry wood, as much as a cubit, stands over the ground,
either of oak or of larch, which is not rotted by rain; and two white
stones are placed on either side, in the narrow part of the way;<span id="footnotetag747"/>

some man long since dead, or perhaps it has been a goal in the time of
former men, and now swift-footed noble Achilles has appointed it the
goal. Approaching this very closely, drive thy chariot and horses near;
but incline thyself gently towards the left of them (the steeds), in the
well-joined chariot-seat; and, cheering on the right-hand horse, apply
the whip, and give him the rein with thy hands. Let thy left-hand horse,
however, be moved close to the goal, so that the nave of the well-made
wheel may appear to touch, the top [of the post]; but avoid to touch
upon the stone, lest thou both wound thy horses, and break thy chariot
in pieces, and be a joy to the others, and a disgrace to thyself. But,
my beloved son, mind to be on thy guard; for if at the goal thou couldst
pass by in the course, there will not be one who could overtake thee in
pursuit, nor pass thee by; not if behind he drives noble Arion, the

<p>Then they all at once raised their lashes over their steeds, and struck
them with the reins, and cheered them on with words incessantly; but
they rapidly flew over the plain, far away from the ships, swiftly, and
beneath their breasts the excited dust stood up, raised like a cloud or
a whirlwind; whilst their manes were tossed about by the breath of the
wind. Sometimes, indeed, the chariots approached the fruitful earth,
and at others bounded aloft; but the drivers stood erect in their
chariots, and the heart of each of them, eager for victory, palpitated:
and each animated his own steeds, but they flew along, stirring up dust
from the plain. But when now the fleet steeds were performing the last
course, back towards the hoary deep, then appeared the excellence of
each, and the course was immediately extended to the horses;<span id="footnotetag751"/>

away. The male Trojan steeds of Diomede, however, bore [themselves] next
to them; nor were they at all far distant, but very near; for they
always seemed as if about to mount into the chariot. And with their
breathing the back and broad shoulders of Eumelus were warmed; for they
flew along, leaning their heads over him. And certainly he had either
passed, or made [the victory] doubtful, had not Phœbus Apollo been
enraged with the son of Tydeus, and accordingly shaken out of his hands
the shining lash. Then from the eyes of him indignant tears poured,
because indeed he beheld the others now going much swifter, whilst his
[steeds] were injured, running without a goad. Neither did Apollo,
fraudulently injuring Tydides, escape the notice of Minerva, but she
very quickly overtook the shepherd of the people, and gave him his lash,
and put vigour into his steeds. And to the son of Admetus, the goddess,
indignant, advanced, and broke for him his horse-yoke; and so his mares
ran on both sides out of the way, and the pole was dashed upon the
ground. He himself was thrown from the driving-seat close by the wheel,
and was lacerated all round in his arms, his mouth, and nostrils, and
his forehead was bruised near the eyebrows; but his eyes were filled
with tears, and his liquid voice was clogged. Then Diomede passing by,
directed his hollow-hoofed steeds, bounding far before the others; for
Minerva had put vigour into his steeds, and given him glory. But after
him, however, the son of Atreus, yellow-haired Menelaus, drove; but
Antilochus cheered on the steeds of his father:</p>

<p>“Push on! and exert yourselves, both of you, as fast as possible. I
indeed do not order you to contend with the steeds of warlike Diomede,
to which Minerva has now given speed, and given glory to him; but
quickly overtake the horses of Atrides, nor be left behind, lest Æthe,
being a mare, shed disgrace upon you both. Why should ye be left
inferior, O best [of steeds]? For thus I tell you, and it shall surely
be accomplished; attention will not be paid to you by Nestor, the
shepherd of the people, but he will immediately slay you with the sharp
brass, if we, remiss, bear off the less worthy prize. But follow, and
hasten as fast as possible. These things will I myself manage and look
to, to pass him by in the narrow way; nor shall it escape me.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but they, dreading the threat of their master, ran faster
for a short time: but immediately then warlike Antilochus perceived the
narrow of the hollow way. It was a fissure of the earth, where the
wintry torrent collected, had broken away [part] of the road, and
gullied the whole place; thither drove Menelaus, avoiding the clash of
wheels. But Antilochus, deviating, guided his solid-hoofed horses out of
the way, and turning aside, pursued him a little. But the son of Atreus
feared, and shouted to Antilochus:</p>
<p>“Antilochus, rashly art thou driving thy horses; but check thy steeds
for the road is narrow, and thou wilt soon drive past in a wider lest
thou damage both [of us], running foul of [my] chariot.” Thus he spoke;
but Antilochus drove even much faster, urging [them] on with the lash,
like unto one not hearing. As far as is the cast of a quoit, hurled from
the shoulder, which a vigorous youth has thrown, making experiments of
his youthful strength; so far they ran abreast; but those of Atrides
fell back: for he himself voluntarily ceased to drive, lest the
solid-hoofed steeds should clash in the road, and overturn the
well-joined chariots, and they themselves should fall in the dust, while
contending for the victory. And him yellow-haired Menelaus, chiding,
addressed:</p>
<p>“O Antilochus, no other mortal is more pernicious than thou. Avaunt! for
we Greeks untruly said that thou wast prudent. Yet not even thus shalt
thou bear away the prize without an oath.” <span id="footnotetag753"/>

on his steeds, and spoke to them:</p>
<p>“Be not kept back, nor stand, grieving in your hearts: sooner will the
feet and knees grow weary to them than to you; for they are both
deprived of vigour.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but they, dreading the exhortation of their master, ran
more fleetly, and became very near the others. But the Greeks sitting in
assembly,<span id="footnotetag754"/>

the plain. Then first Idomeneus, leader of the Cretans, distinguished
the horses; for he sat outside the circus, very high up, on an
observatory; and hearing him, being far off, encouraging [his steeds],
knew him. He also perceived a remarkable steed outstripping, which in
every other part indeed was chesnut, but in its forehead was a white
round spot, like the moon. And he stood erect, and delivered this speech
amongst the Greeks:</p>

<p>“O friends, leaders and chieftains of the Greeks, do I alone recognize
the horses, or do ye also? Different steeds indeed appear to me to be
foremost, and there seems a different charioteer; but those [mares]
which hitherto were successful, are probably hurt upon the plain
somewhere: for surely I first saw them turning round the goal, but now I
can no longer see them, although my eyes survey the Trojan plain as I
gaze around. Surely the reins have fled the charioteer, and he could not
rein well round the goal, and did not succeed in turning. There I

<p>But him the leader of the Cretans, indignant, answered in turn:</p>

to the Greeks, because thy temper is morose; come now, let us stake a

<p>Thus he spoke; but swift Ajax, son of Oïleus, immediately rose to reply
in harsh words. And now doubtless the strife would have proceeded
farther to both, had not Achilles himself risen up, and spoke:</p>
<p>“No longer now, O Ajax and Idomeneus, hold altercation in evil, angry
words, for it is not fitting, and ye also would blame another, whoever
should do such things; but, sitting down in the circus, look towards the
steeds, which themselves will soon arrive, contending for victory; and
then will ye know, each of you, the horses of the Greeks, which are
second, and which first.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but the son of Tydeus came very near, pursuing, and
always drove on [his horses] with the lash across the shoulders; whilst
the steeds were raised up aloft into the air, quickly completing their
course, and the drops of dust kept always bespattering their charioteer.
The chariot, adorned with gold and tin, rolled on close to the
swift-footed steeds; nor was there a deep trace of the tires behind in
the fine dust, but they, hastening, flew. But he stood in the midst of
the circus, and much perspiration exuded from the steeds, from their
necks and chest to the ground. But he himself leaped to the ground from
his all-shining chariot, and rested his scourge against the yoke; nor
was gallant Sthenelus dilatory, but he eagerly seized the prize, and
gave the woman to his magnanimous companions to escort, and the handled
tripod to bear away; whilst he himself unyoked the steeds.</p>
<p>Next to him Nelcian Antilochus drove his steeds, outstripping Menelaus
by stratagem, not indeed by speed. Yet even thus Menelaus drove his
swift horses near; but as far as a horse is distant from the wheel,
which, exerting its speed with the chariot, draws its master through the
plain, and the extreme hairs of its tail touch the wheel-tire, but it
rolls very near, nor is there much space between, while it runs over the
vast plain; so far was illustrious Menelaus left behind by Antilochus:
although at first he was left behind as much as the cast of a quoit, yet
he quickly overtook him; for the doughty strength of Agamemnon’s mare,
the beautiful-maned Æthe, was increased. And if the course had been
still longer to both, he would surely have passed him by, nor left it
doubtful. Meriones again, the good attendant of Idomeneus, was left
behind a spear’s throw by the illustrious Menelaus, for his fair-maned
steeds were the slowest, and he himself least skilful in driving a
chariot in the contest. But the son of Admetus came last of others,
dragging his beauteous chariot, driving his steeds before him. But him
swift-footed, noble Achilles seeing, pitied, and standing amongst the
Greeks, spoke [to him] winged words:</p>
<p>“The best man drives his solid-hoofed steeds the last. But come, let us
give him, as is right, the second prize; and let the son of Tydeus bear
away the first.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; and all approved as he ordered. And now truly he had
given the mare to him (for the Greeks approved it), had not Antilochus,
the son of magnanimous Nestor, rising up, replied to Achilles, the son
of Peleus, on the question of justice:<span id="footnotetag758"/>

   the Scholiast, have interpreted δίκη. That would have required

<p>“Ο Achilles, I shall be very indignant with thee, if thou fulfillest
this promise; for thou art about to deprive me of my reward, considering
these things, that his chariot and fleet steeds were injured, he himself
being skilful; but he should have prayed to the immortals, then would he
by no means have come up driving the last. But if thou pitiest him, and
it be agreeable to thy mind, thou hast much gold and brass in thy tent,
and cattle and maidens, and solid-hoofed steeds are thine. Taking from
these, give him afterwards even a greater reward, or even now forthwith,
that the Greeks may applaud thee. This, however, I will not resign, but
let him of the warriors strive for her, whoever wishes to contend with
me in strength of hands.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; and swift-footed, noble Achilles smiled, favouring
Antilochus, for he was a dear companion to him; and, answering,
addressed to him winged words:</p>
<p>“O Antilochus, since thou now biddest me give something else to Eumelus
from my house, this will I indeed accomplish. I will give him the
corslet which I took from Asteropæus, brazen, around which there is
entwined a rim of shining tin; and it is of great value.”</p>
<p>He spoke; and ordered his dear comrade, Automedon, to bear it from the
tent: and he went and brought it to him; then he placed it in the hands
of Eumelus, and he received it rejoicing. But Menelaus also arose
amongst them, grieving in his mind, vehemently enraged with Antilochus.
Then a herald placed the sceptre in his hands, and ordered the Greeks to
be silent; and then the godlike hero spoke:</p>
<p>“O Antilochus, hitherto prudent, what hast thou done? Thou hast
disgraced my skill, and injured my steeds, driving thine before them,
which indeed are greatly inferior. But come, ye leaders and chiefs of
the Greeks, judge between us both, and not for favour; lest some one of
the brazen-mailed Greeks should say: ‘Menelaus having overcome
Antilochus by falsehoods, came off, leading the mare [as a prize], for
his steeds were very inferior, but he himself superior in skill and
strength.’<span id="footnotetag759"/>

errors of a youth; for his mind is indeed more volatile, and his counsel

<p>“Antilochus, now indeed will I cease being enraged with thee, for

<p>Thus speaking, he placed it in his hands; but he rejoicing, accepted it,
and addressing him, spoke in winged words:</p>
<p>“Assuredly, O my son, thou hast spoken all these things aright; for no
longer are my limbs firm, my friend, nor my feet, nor yet do my hands
move pliant on each side from my shoulders. Would that I were as young,
and my strength was firm to me, as when the Epeans buried king
Amarynceus at Byprasium, and his sons staked the prizes of the king.
There no man was equal to me, neither of the Epeans, nor of the Pelians
themselves, nor of the magnanimous Ætolians. In the cæstus I conquered
Clytomedes, the son of Enops; and in wrestling, Ancæus, the Pleuronian,
who rose up against me; and on foot I outstripped Iphiclus, though being
excellent; and with the spear hurled beyond Phyleus and Polydorus. The
two sons of Actor drove by me by their steeds only, exceeding me in
number, envying me the victory, for the greatest rewards were left for
that contest. But they were two; the one indeed steadily directed the
reins, whilst the other urged on with the lash. Thus I formerly was, but
now let younger men undertake such deeds, as it becomes me to obey sad
old age, though I then excelled amongst heroes. But go, and celebrate
thy comrade’s obsequies with games. This, indeed, I willingly accept,
and my soul rejoices that thou art ever mindful of me; nor am I
forgotten by thee, with what honour it becomes me to be honoured among
the Greeks. And for these things may the gods give thee a proper
return.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but the son of Peleus went through the great assemblage
of the Greeks, when he had heard all the praise of Nestor. Then he
proposed prizes for a laborious boxing-match.<span id="footnotetag765"/>

patient of toil, six years old, unbroken, which is most difficult to be

two-handled cup: then he stood up, and spoke amongst the Greeks:</p>

<p>“O ye sons of Atreus, and other well-greaved Greeks, we invite two men,
who are very expert, raising their hands aloft, to strike for these with
the fist. But to whom Apollo indeed may give victory, and all the Greeks
approve, leading away the mule, patient of labour, let him conduct it to
his tent; but the vanquished shall bear away a double cup.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; and immediately arose a man brave and great, skilled in
the art of boxing, Epëus, son of Panopeus; and grasping the
patient-toiling mule, said:</p>
<p>“Let him draw near, whosoever will bear away the double cup; but I
think that no other of the Greeks having conquered in boxing, will lead
away the mule; for I boast myself to be the best man. Is it not enough
that I am inferior in battle?<span id="footnotetag766"/>

man to be skilled in every work. For thus I tell you, and it shall be

vanquished by my hands.”</p>

<p>Thus he spoke; but they were all mute, in silence. But Euryalus alone
stood up against him, a godlike hero, son of king Mecisteus, a
descendant of Talaïon, who formerly came to Thebes to the funeral of the
deceased Œdipus, and there vanquished all the Cadmeans. About him the
spear-renowned son of Tydeus was busied, encouraging him with words, for
he greatly wished victory to him. And first he threw around him his
girdle, and then gave him the well-cut thongs [made of the hide] of a
rustic ox. But they twain, having girded themselves, proceeded into the
middle of the circus, and both at the same time engaged, with their
strong hands opposite, raising [them up], and their heavy hands were
mingled. Then a horrid crashing of jaws ensued, and the sweat flowed on
all sides from their limbs. Then noble Epëus rushed in, and smote him
upon the cheek, while looking round, nor could he stand any longer; but
his fair limbs tottered under him. And as when, from beneath the
surface, rippled<span id="footnotetag767"/>

shore, and the dark billow covers it, so he, stricken, sprang up. But
magnanimous Epëus, taking [him] in his hands, lifted him up; and his
dear comrades stood around, who conducted him through the circus on
tottering feet, spitting out clotted gore, [and] drooping his head on
each side; and then, leading, placed him among them, insensible, while
they, departing, received the double cup.</p>
<p>But the son of Peleus quickly staked other third prizes for laborious
wrestling, exhibiting [them] to the Greeks; for the conqueror, indeed, a
large tripod, ready for the fire,<span id="footnotetag768"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-23.htm.html#footnote768" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">768</sup></a> which the Greeks estimated
amongst themselves at twelve oxen; and for the conquered person he
placed a female in the midst. She understood various works, and they
reckoned her at four oxen. But he stood up, and spoke this speech among
the Greeks:</p>
<p>“Arise, ye who will make trial of this contest.” Thus he spoke; but then
arose mighty Telamonian Ajax, and wise Ulysses stood up, skilled in
stratagems. But these two, having girded themselves, advanced into the

sweat poured down; and thick welds, purple with blood, arose upon their
sides and shoulders. Yet always eagerly they sought desired victory, for
the sake of the well-made tripod. Neither could Ulysses trip, nor throw
him to the ground, nor could Ajax him, for the valiant might of Ulysses
hindered him. But when at length they were wearying the well-greaved
Greeks, then mighty Telamonian Ajax addressed him:</p>

<p>“Ο most noble son of Laërtes, Ulysses of many wiles, either lift up me,
or I thee, and all these things will be a care to Jove.”</p>
<p>So saying, he lifted him up: but yet was not Ulysses unmindful of a
stratagem. Aiming at his ham, he struck him behind, and relaxed his
limbs, and threw him on his back; but Ulysses fell upon his breast; then
the people admiring gazed, and were stupified. Next noble, much-enduring
Ulysses, lifted him in turn, and moved him a little from the ground, nor
did he lift him up completely; but he bent his knee; and both fell upon
the ground near to each other, and were defiled with dust. And, getting
up, they had surely wrestled for the third time, had not Achilles
himself stood up and restrained them:</p>
<p>“No longer contend, nor exhaust yourselves with evils; for there is
victory to both: so depart, receiving equal rewards, in order that the
other Greeks also may contend.” Thus he spoke; but they indeed heard him
willingly, and obeyed; and, wiping off the dust, put on their tunics.
But the son of Peleus immediately staked other rewards of swiftness, a
wrought silver cup, which contained, indeed, six measures, but in beauty
much excelled [all] upon the whole earth, for the ingenious Sidonians
had wrought it cunningly, and Phœnician men had carried it over the
shadowy sea, and exposed it for sale in the harbours, and presented it
as a gift to Thoas. Euneus, son of Jason, however, had given it to the
hero Patroclus, as a ransom for Lycaon, son of Priam. This also Achilles
offered as a new prize, to be contended for, in honour of his companion,
whoever should be the nimblest on swift feet; for the second, again, he
proposed an ox, large and luxuriant in fat; and for the last he staked
half a talent of gold. But he stood upright, and spoke amongst the
Greeks:</p>
<p>“Arise, ye who will make trial of this contest also.” Thus he spoke; and
immediately swift Ajax, son of Oïleus, arose, and much-enduring Ulysses;
and after them Antilochus, son of Nestor; for he, indeed, excelled all
the youths in fleetness. But they stood in order, and Achilles pointed
out the goal; and their course was stretched out from the goal.<span id="footnotetag771"/>

Then swiftly leaped forth the son of Oïleus; but very close after him
rushed noble Ulysses; as when a shuttle is at the breast of a
well-girdled dame, which she throws very skilfully with her hands,
drawing out the woof, [and inserting them] into the warp, and holds it
near her breast: so ran Ulysses near him; and with his feet trod on his
footsteps behind, before the dust was shed over them. But noble Ulysses,
constantly running swiftly, exhaled his breath upon his head; and all
the Greeks shouted to him, eager for victory, and encouraged him,
hastening rapidly. But when they were now completing their last course,
Ulysses forthwith prayed in his mind to azure-eyed Minerva:</p>

   Smith’s Dict. of Antiquities.</p>
<p>“Hear, O goddess, come a propitious assistant to my feet.” Thus he
spoke, praying; but Pallas Minerva heard him; and she made his limbs
nimble, his feet and his hands above. But when they were just about to
fly in upon the prize, then Ajax slipped, while running (for Minerva did
the mischief), where the dung of the deep-lowing slaughtered oxen was
around, which swift-footed Achilles had slain in honour of Patroclus.
Then much-enduring, noble Ulysses took up the goblet, as he came running
the first; and illustrious Ajax received the ox. But he stood, holding
the horn of the rustic ox in his hands; and, spitting out the dung,
spoke amongst the Greeks:</p>
<p>“Alas! surely a goddess injured my feet, who ever of old stands by
Ulysses as a mother, and assists him.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; and they all then laughed heartily at him. But Antilochus
next bore away the last prize, smiling, and spoke among the Greeks:</p>
<p>“I will tell you all, my friends, though now knowing it, that even still
the immortals honour the aged. For Ajax, indeed, is a little older than
I am: but he is of a former generation, and former men; and they say
that he is of crude old age, and it is difficult for the Greeks to
contend in swiftness with him, except for Achilles.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; and praised the swift-footed son of Peleus. But Achilles,
answering, addressed him with words:</p>
<p>“Thy praise, O Antilochus, shall not be spoken in vain, but for thee I
will add half a talent of gold.”</p>
<p>So saying, he placed it in his hands; and he, rejoicing, received it.
But the son of Peleus, bearing into the circus, laid down a long spear,
and a shield, and helmet, the arms of Sarpedon, which Patroclus had
stripped him of; and stood upright, and spoke amongst the Greeks:</p>
<p>“We invite two warriors, whoever are bravest, having put; on these arms,
[and] seizing the flesh-rending brass, to make trial of each other
before the host for these. Whoever shall be the first to wound the fair
flesh, and touch the entrails through the armour and black blood, to
him, indeed, will I give this silver-studded, beautiful Thracian sword,
which I formerly took from Asteropæus. But let both bear away these arms
in common, and before them I will place a splendid banquet in my tents.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but then arose mighty Telamonian Ajax, and the son of
Tydeus, valiant Diomede rose up. But they, after they had armed apart on
either side from the ground, both came together into the midst, eager to
fight, looking dreadfully; and stupor possessed all the Greeks. But when
approaching each other, they were near, thrice indeed they rushed on,
and thrice made the attack hand to hand. Then Ajax, indeed, pierced
through his shield, equal on all sides, nor reached the flesh; for the
corslet inside protected him. But next the son of Tydeus, with the point
of his shining spear, endeavoured to reach the neck, over his great
shield. And then, indeed, the Greeks, fearing for Ajax, desired them,
ceasing, to take up equal rewards. The hero, however, gave the great
sword to Diomede, bearing it both with the sheath and the well-cut belt.</p>
<p>Then the son of Peleus deposited a rudely-molten mass of iron, which
the great might of Eëtion used formerly to hurl. But when swift-footed,
noble Achilles slew him, he brought this also, with other possessions,
in his ships. Then he stood up, and spoke amongst the Greeks:</p>
<p>“Arise, you who will make trial of this contest also. Even if his rich
fields be of very far and wide extent, using this he will have it even
for five revolving years; for indeed neither will his shepherd nor his
ploughman go into the city wanting iron, but [this] will furnish it.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; then up arose warlike Polypœtes, and the valiant might of
godlike Leonteus arose; also Telamonian Ajax, and noble Epëus arose.
Then they stood in order; but noble Epëus seized the mass, and, whirling
it round, threw it; but all the Greeks laughed at him. Next Leonteus, a
branch of Mars, threw second; but third, mighty Telamonian Ajax hurled
with his strong hand, and cast beyond the marks of all. But when now
warlike Polypœtes had seized the mass, as far as a cow-herdsman throws
his crook, which, whirled around, flies through the herds of oxen, so
far, through the whole stadium, did he cast beyond; but they shouted
aloud; and the companions of brave Polypœtes, rising up, bore away the
prize of the king to the hollow ships.</p>
<p>Next, for the archers, he staked iron fit for making arrows,<span id="footnotetag772"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-23.htm.html#footnote772" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">772</sup></a> and
laid down ten battle-axes, and also ten demi-axes. He also set upright
the mast of an azure-prowed vessel, afar upon the sands; from [this] he
fastened a timid dove by a slender cord, by the foot, at which he
ordered [them] to shoot:</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote772"/><b>Footnote 772:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-23.htm.html#footnotetag772" class="pginternal">
(return) </a> <i>I.e.</i> well-tempered.</p>
<p>“Whosoever indeed shall strike the timid dove, taking up all the
battle-axes, may bear [them] to his tent; but whosoever shall hit the
cord, missing the bird (for he is inferior), let him bear off the
demi-axes.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but then up rose the might of king Teucer, and up rose
Meriones, the active attendant of Idomeneus; and taking the lots, they
shook them in a brazen helmet. But Teucer was appointed first by lot;
and straightway he shot an arrow strenuously, nor did he vow to
sacrifice a celebrated hecatomb of firstling lambs to king [Apollo]. He
missed the bird indeed, because Apollo envied him this, but he hit the
string with which the bird was fastened, close to its foot; and the
bitter arrow cut the cord quite through. Then indeed the bird ascended
towards heaven, but the cord was sent down towards the earth: and the
Greeks shouted applause. But Meriones, hastening, snatched the bow from
his hand; and now held the arrow for a long time, as he had directed it;
and immediately vowed to sacrifice to far-darting Apollo a noble
hecatomb of firstling lambs. But he saw the timid dove on high beneath
the clouds, which, as she was turning round, he hit in the middle under
the wing, and the arrow pierced quite through. And it indeed again was
fixed in the ground at the foot of Meriones: but the bird, alighting
upon the mast of the azure-beaked galley, drooped its neck, and its
close wings were at the same time expanded. And swift its soul flitted
from its members, and it fell far from [the mast]; but the people
wondering, beheld, and were stupified. Then Meriones took up all the ten
battle-axes, and Teucer carried off the demi-axes to the hollow barks.</p>
<p>Then the son of Peleus indeed, bearing it into the circus, staked a long
spear, and also a caldron, untouched by fire, worth an ox, adorned with
flowers; and immediately the spearmen arose. The son of Atreus rose up,
wide-ruling Agamemnon, and Meriones, the expert attendant of Idomeneus;
whom also swift-footed, noble Achilles addressed:</p>
<p>“O son of Atreus, for we know how much thou dost surpass all, as well as
how much thou excellest in strength and in the javelin, wherefore thou
indeed mayest repair to the hollow barks, possessing this reward; but
let us give the spear to the hero Meriones, if, truly, thou dost thus
wish it in thy mind; for I on my part advise it.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; nor did the king of men, Agamemnon, disobey; but he gave
the brazen spear to Meriones; and the hero himself gave the very
splendid prize to the herald Talthybius.</p>
