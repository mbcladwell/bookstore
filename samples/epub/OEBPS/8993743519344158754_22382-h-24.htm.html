<h2>BOOK THE TWENTY-FOURTH.</h2>
<h4 id="pgepubid00054">ARGUMENT.</h4>
<p>Jove orders Thetis to go to Achilles, and demand the restoration of
Hector’s body. Mercury is also sent to Priam, whom he guides in safety
through the Grecian camp, to the tent of Achilles. A pathetic interview
follows, and Priam ransoms the body of his son, and obtains a twelve
days’ truce, during which he performs his funeral obsequies.</p>
<p class="p2">
The assembly was dissolved, and the people were dispersed, to go each to
their hollow barks. They indeed took care to indulge in the banquet and
sweet slumber; but Achilles wept, remembering his dear companion, nor
did all-subduing sleep possess him, but he was rolled here and there,
longing for the vigour and valiant might of Patroclus. And whatever
things he had accomplished with him, and hardships he had suffered, both
[encountering] the battles of heroes, and measuring the grievous waves,
remembering these things, he shed the warm tear, lying at one time upon
his sides,<span id="footnotetag773"/>

face; but again starting up, he wandered about in sadness along the
shore of the sea; nor did Morn, appearing over the sea and the shores,
escape his notice. But he, when he had harnessed his fleet steeds to his
chariot, bound Hector to be dragged after his chariot; and having drawn
him thrice around the tomb of the dead son of Menœtius, again rested in
his tent; and left him there, having stretched him on his face in the
dust. But Apollo kept off all pollution from his body, pitying the hero,
although dead; and encircled him with the golden ægis, lest that,
dragging, he might lacerate him.</p>

   genuine, they furnish the earliest mention of the judgment of
   Paris. Cf. Mollus on Longus, Past. iii. 27; Intpp. on Hygin. Fab.
   xcii.</p>
<p>“Cruel ye are, O gods, [and] injurious. Has not Hector indeed formerly
burned for you the thighs of bulls and chosen goats? whom now, although
being dead, ye will not venture to take away for his wife, and mother,
his son, and his father Priam, and the people to behold; who would
quickly burn him with fire, and perform his funeral rites. But ye wish
to bestow favour, O gods, upon destructive Achilles, to whom there is
neither just disposition, nor flexible feelings in his breast; who is
skilled in savage deeds, as a lion, which, yielding to the impulse of
his mighty strength and haughty soul, attacks the flocks of men, that he
may take a repast. Thus has Achilles lost all compassion, nor in him is
there sense of shame, which greatly hurts and profits men. For perhaps
some one will lose another more dear, either a brother, or a son; yet
does he cease weeping and lamenting, for the Destinies have placed in
men an enduring mind. But this man drags godlike Hector around the tomb
of his dear companion, binding him to his chariot, after he has taken
away his dear life; yet truly this is neither more honourable, nor
better for him. [Let him beware] lest we be indignant with him, brave as
he is, because, raging, he insults even the senseless clay.”</p>
<p>But him the white-armed Juno, indignant, addressed: “This truly might be
our language, O God of the silver bow, if now thou assignest equal
honour to Achilles and to Hector. Hector indeed is a mortal, and sucked
a woman’s breast; but Achilles is the offspring of a goddess, whom I
myself both nurtured and educated, and gave as a wife to the hero
Peleus, who is dear to the immortals in their heart: and ye were all
present at the nuptials,<span id="footnotetag776"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-24.htm.html#footnote776" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">776</sup></a> O gods; and thou didst feast amongst them,
holding thy lyre, O companion of the evil, ever faithless.”</p>
<p>But her cloud-compelling Jove, answering, addressed:</p>
<p>“Ο Juno, be not now completely enraged with the gods; for their honour
shall not be at all equal: but Hector also was the dearest of mortals to
the gods, of [those] who are in Ilium; for thus was he to me; for never
did he miss [offering] pleasing gifts. For never did my altar lack the
fitting banquet, or incense, or odour: for this honour are we allotted.
Yet let us forego to steal away bold Hector; (nor is it at all
practicable without the knowledge of Achilles;) for he is ever by him
both by night and day, like as a mother. But let some of the gods call
Thetis near me, that to her I may tell prudent advice, in order that
Achilles may receive gifts from Priam, and ransom Hector.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but Iris, swift as the whirlwind, rose up, about to bear
his message. Half way between Samos and rugged Imbrus she plunged into
the dark sea, and the ocean groaned. She sank to the bottom like unto a
leaden ball,<span id="footnotetag777"/>

entering, descends, bearing death to the raw-devouring fishes. But she
found Thetis in her hollow cave, and the other sea goddesses sat around
her, assembled together; she indeed, in the midst, lamented the fate of
her own blameless son, who was about to perish in fertile Troy, far away
from his native land. But her swift-footed Iris, standing near,
addressed:</p>

(return) </a> The only clear explanation of this passage seems
   to be that of the traveller Clarke, quoted by Kennedy, as
   follows: “The Greeks in fishing let their line, with the lead at
   the end, run over a piece of horn fixed at the side of the boat,”
   to prevent, as Kennedy remarks, the wear from friction. Pollux,
   x. 30, 31, merely mentions the μολυβδαίνη among the implements of
   fishermen; but says nothing of the manner in which it was used.</p>
<p>“Rise, O Thetis; Jove, skilled in imperishable counsels, calls thee.”</p>
<p>Her then the silver-footed goddess Thetis answered:</p>
<p>“Why does that mighty god call me? I am ashamed to mix with the
immortals, for I have innumerable griefs in my soul. Yet must I go; for
the word which he utters will not be in vain.”</p>
<p>Thus having spoken, the divine one of goddesses took her dark robe, than
which no garment is blacker. And she set out to go, whilst wind-footed,
fleet Iris led the way; and the water of the sea retired on each side of
them.<span id="footnotetag778"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-24.htm.html#footnote778" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">778</sup></a> Next ascending the shore, they were impelled up to heaven.
They found the far-sounding son of Saturn; and all the other blessed
immortal gods sat assembled around him; but she then sat down beside
father Jove, and Minerva gave place to her. Then Juno placed a beautiful
golden goblet in her hand, and consoled her with words; and Thetis
having drunk, returned it. But to them the father of men and gods began
discourse:</p>
<p>“Thou hast come to Olympus, although sad, Ο goddess Thetis, having in
thy mind a grief not to be forgotten; and I know it. Yet even thus will
I speak, and on this account have I called thee hither. Nine days has a
contest already been excited amongst the immortals respecting the body
of Hector, and Achilles the destroyer of cities, and they have urged the
watchful slayer of Argus to steal him. But I bestow this glory<span id="footnotetag779"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-24.htm.html#footnote779" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">779</sup></a> on
Achilles, securing for the future thy respect and love. Descend very
speedily to the camp, and give orders to thy son. Tell him that the gods
are offended, and that I am angry above all the immortals, because with
infuriated mind he detains Hector at the crooked barks, nor has released
him: if perchance he will revere me, and restore Hector. Meanwhile I
will despatch Iris to magnanimous Priam, that, going to the ships of the
Greeks, he may ransom his beloved son, and carry offerings to Achilles,
which may melt his soul.”</p>

(return) </a> “The sense is: <i>I have not sanctioned the proposal
   that the body of Hector should be removed furtively, in order
   that an opportunity might be offered to Achilles of receiving a
   ransom for it, which would redound to his glory</i>.”—Kennedy.</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; nor did the silver-footed goddess Thetis disobey; but,
rushing impetuously, she descended down from the tops of Olympus. Then
she came to the tent of her son, and found him within, moaning
continually, whilst around him his dear comrades were busily occupied,
and prepared a feast, for a great thick-fleeced sheep had been
slaughtered by them in the tent. But his venerable mother sat down very
near him, and caressed him with her hand, and spoke, and addressed him:</p>
<p>“O my son, how long, grieving and bewailing, wilt thou afflict thine
heart, being not at all mindful of either food or bed? But it is good to
be mingled in love with a woman; for thou shalt not live long for me,
but Death and stern Fate already stand near thee. But quickly attend to
me, for I am a messenger to thee from Jove. He says that the gods are
angry with thee, and that he himself above all the immortals is enraged,
because with furious mind thou detainest Hector at the hollow ships, nor
dost release him. But come, release him, and receive ransoms for the
dead body.”</p>
<p>But her swift-footed Achilles, answering, addressed:</p>
<p>“Let him approach hither, who may bear the ransoms, and bear away the
body, if indeed the Olympian himself now commands it with a serious
mind.” Thus they indeed, the mother and the son, amongst the assemblage
of the ships, spoke many winged words to each other; but the son of
Saturn impelled Iris towards sacred Ilium:</p>
<p>“Go quickly, fleet Iris, having left the seat of Olympus, order
magnanimous Priam to ransom his dear son to Ilium, going to the ships of
the Greeks; and to carry gifts to Achilles, which may appease his mind,
alone; nor let another man of the Trojans go with him. Let some aged
herald accompany him, who may guide his mules and well-wheeled chariot,
and may bear back to the city the dead body which noble Achilles has
slain; nor let death at all be a cause of anxiety to his mind, nor at
all a terror; such a conductor, the slayer of Argus, will we give to
him, who shall lead him, until, directing, he shall place him beside
Achilles. But when he shall have conducted him into the tent of
Achilles, he will not kill him himself, and he will ward off all others;
for he is neither imprudent, nor rash, nor profane; but will very
humanely spare a suppliant man.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but wind-footed Iris rushed on, about to carry her
message. She came to [the palace] of Priam, and found wailing and
lamentation. His sons, sitting around their father within the hall, were
drenching their robes with tears; whilst the old man sat in the midst,
covered entirely<span id="footnotetag780"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-24.htm.html#footnote780" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">780</sup></a> with a cloak; but much filth was around upon the
head and neck of the aged man, which, while rolling [on the ground], he
had abundantly collected<span id="footnotetag781"/>

daughters-in-law throughout the dwelling lamented, remembering those
who, many and brave, lay, having lost their lives by the hands of the
Greeks. Then the ambassadress of Jove stood beside Priam, and addressed
him in an under-tone; and tremor seized him as to his limbs:</p>
<p>“Take courage, O Dardanian Priam, in thy mind, nor fear at all; for
indeed I come not hither boding<span id="footnotetag782"/>

for I am an ambassadress from Jove to thee, who, though being far off,
greatly cares for and pities thee. The Olympian bids thee ransom noble
Hector, and bear presents to Achilles, which may melt his soul; thee
alone, nor let another man of the Trojans go with thee. But let some
aged herald accompany thee, who may guide thy mules and well-wheeled
chariot, and bring back to the city the dead which noble Achilles has
slain. Nor let death be a cause of anxiety to thy mind, nor fear at all
such a conductor; the slayer of Argus shall attend thee, who shall lead
thee, until, guiding, he shall bring thee near Achilles. But when he
shall have led thee into the tent of Achilles, he will not slay thee
himself, and he will ward off all others; for he is neither imprudent,
nor rash, nor profane; but will very humanely spare a suppliant man.”</p>

<p>Thus having spoken, swift-footed Iris departed. But he ordered his sons
to prepare his well-wheeled mule-drawn chariot, and to tie a chest upon
it; but he descended into an odoriferous chamber of cedar, lofty-roofed,
which contained many rarities, and called in his wife Hecuba, and said:</p>
<p>“Unhappy one, an Olympian messenger has come to me from Jove, [that I
should] ransom my dear son, going to the ships of the Greeks, and should
bear gifts to Achilles, which may melt his soul. But come, tell this to
me, what does it appear to thee in thy mind? For my strength and courage
vehemently urge me myself to go thither to the ships, into the wide army
of the Greeks.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke: but his spouse wept, and answered him in words:</p>
<p>“Ah me, where now is thy prudence gone, for which thou wast formerly
distinguished among foreigners, and among those whom thou dost govern?
Why dost thou wish to go alone to the ships of the Greeks, before the
eyes of the man who slew thy many and brave sons? Certainly an iron

man, the very middle of whose liver I wish that I had hold of, that,
clinging to it, I might devour it; then would the deeds done against my
son be repaid; for he did not slay him behaving as a coward, but
standing forth in defence of the Trojan men and deep-bosomed Trojan
dames, neither mindful of flight nor of receding.”</p>

<p>But her again the aged, godlike Priam addressed:</p>
<p>“Do not detain me, desirous to go, nor be thou thyself an evil-omen bird
in my palaces; nor shalt thou persuade me. For if indeed any other of
earthly beings had ordered me, whether they be prophets, soothsayers, or
priests, we might have pronounced it a falsehood, and been the more
averse. But now since I myself have heard it from a deity, and have
beheld her face to face, I will go, nor shall this word be vain and if
it be my fate to die at the ships of the brazen-mailed Greeks, I am
willing; for Achilles will forthwith, slay me, embracing my son in my
arms, after I have taken away the desire of weeping.”</p>
<p>He spoke; and opened the beautiful lids of the chests, and took out
thence twelve beautiful mantles, twelve single cloaks, as many
tapestried rugs, and, in addition to these, as many tunics; and having
weighed it, he took out ten whole talents of gold. He took out beside
two glittering tripods, and four goblets, and a very beautiful cup,
which the Thracian men had given him when going on an embassy, a mighty
possession. Nor now did the old man spare even this in his palaces; for
he greatly wished in his mind to ransom his dear son. And he drove away
all the Trojans from his porch, chiding them with reproachful words:</p>
<p>“Depart, wretched, reproachful [creatures]; is there not indeed grief to
you at home, that ye should come fretting me? Or do ye esteem it of
little consequence that Jove, the son of Saturn, has sent sorrows upon
me, that I should have lost my bravest son? But ye too shall perceive
it, for ye will be much more easy for the Greeks to destroy now, he
being dead; but I will descend even to the abode of Hades, before I
behold with mine eyes the city sacked and plundered.”</p>
<p>He spoke; and chased away the men with his staff; but they went out, the
old man driving [them]. He indeed rebuked his own sons, reviling
Helenus, Paris, and godlike Agathon, Pammon, Antiphonus, and Polites,
brave in the din of battle, Deïphobus, Hippothous, and renowned Dius. To
these nine the old man, reproaching, gave orders:</p>
<p>“Haste for me, O slothful children, disgraceful; would that you had all
been slain at the swift ships, instead of Hector. Ah me! the most
unhappy of all, since I have begotten the bravest sons in wide Troy; but
none of whom I think is left: godlike Mestor, and Troulus, who fought
from his chariot, and Hector, who was a god among men, for he did not
appear to be the son of a mortal man, but of a god. These indeed has
Mars destroyed to me; but all these disgraces remain, liars,
dancers,<span id="footnotetag785"/> <a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-24.htm.html#footnote785" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">785</sup></a>

out the well-wheeled, mule-drawn chariot, beautiful, newly built, and
tied the chest<span id="footnotetag786"/>

from the pin, made of box-wood, and embossed, well fitted with rings,
and then they brought out the yoke-band, nine cubits in length, along
with the yoke. And this indeed they adjusted carefully to the pole at
its extremity, and threw the ring over the bolt. Thrice they lapped it
on either side to the boss; and when they had fastened, they turned it
evenly under the bend; then, bearing the inestimable ransoms of Hector’s
head from the chamber, they piled them upon the well-polished car. Then
they yoked the strong-hoofed mules, patient in labour, which the Mysians
formerly gave to Priam, splendid gifts. They also led under the yoke for
Priam, the horses, which the old man himself had fed at the
well-polished manger. These indeed the herald and Priam yoked in the
lofty palace, having prudent counsels in their minds. But near them came
Hecuba, with sad mind, bearing sweet wine in her right hand, in a golden
goblet, in order that having made libations, they might depart. But she
stood before the steeds, and spoke, and addressed them:</p>

return home again from the hostile men; since indeed thy mind urges thee
to the ships, I at least not being willing. But do thou pray now to the
dark, cloud-compelling Idæan son of Saturn, who looks down upon all
Troy; but seek the fleet bird, his messenger, which to him is the most
pleasing of birds, and whose strength is very great, on thy right hand,
so that, marking him thyself with thine eyes, thou mayest go, relying on

<p>But her godlike Priam answering, addressed:</p>
<p>“O spouse, certainly I will not disobey thee, advising this; for it is
good to raise one’s hands to Jove, if perchance he may compassionate
me.”</p>
<p>The old man spoke, and bade the attending servant pour pure water upon
his hands; for a handmaid stood by, holding in her hands a basin, and
also an ewer; and having washed himself, he took the goblet from his
wife. Then he prayed, standing in the midst of the enclosure, and poured
out a libation of wine, looking towards heaven; and raising his voice,
spoke:</p>
<p>“O father Jove, ruling from Ida, most glorious, most great, grant me to
come acceptable and pitied to [the tent] of Achilles; and send the swift
bird, thy messenger, which is the most agreeable of birds to thee, and
whose strength is very great, on my right hand; that I myself,
perceiving him with my eyes, may go, relying on him, to the ships of the
fleet-horsed Greeks.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, praying; but to him provident Jove hearkened, and
immediately sent an eagle, the Black Hunter, the most certain augury of
birds, which they also call Percnos.<span id="footnotetag788"/>

great were its wings on each side; and it appeared to them, rushing on
the right hand over the city. But they, having seen it, rejoiced, and
the soul was overjoyed in their bosoms. Then the old man, hastening,
mounted his polished car, and drove out of the vestibule and
much-echoing porch. Before, indeed, the mules drew the four-wheeled car,
which prudent Idæus drove; but after [came] the horses, which the old
man cheered on, driving briskly through the city with his lash; but all
his friends accompanied, greatly weeping for him, as if going to death.
But when they had descended from the city, and reached the plain, his
sons and sons-in-law then returned to Ilium. Nor did these two,
advancing on the plain, escape the notice of far-seeing Jove; but,
seeing the old man, he pitied him, and straightway addressed his beloved
son:</p>

Immediately then he fastened under his feet his beautiful sandals,
ambrosial, golden, which carry him as well over the sea, as over the
boundless earth, with the blasts of the wind. He also took his rod, with
which he soothes the eyes of those men whom he wishes, and again excites
others who are asleep; holding this in his hands, the powerful slayer of
Argus flew along. But he immediately reached the Troad and the
Hellespont, and hastened to go, like unto a princely youth, first
springing into youth, whose youth is very graceful. And they, when they
had driven by the great tomb of Ilus, stopped their mules and horses,
that they might drink in the river; for even now twilight had come over
the earth. But the herald, spying, observed Mercury near, and addressed
Priam, and said:</p>

   note.</p>
<p>“Beware, O descendant of Dardanus; this is matter for prudent thought. I
perceive a warrior, and I think that he will soon destroy us. But come,
let us fly upon our steeds; or let us now, grasping his knees, entreat
him, if he would pity us.” Thus he spoke, but the mind of the old man
was confounded, and he greatly feared; but the hair stood upright on his
bending limbs. And he stood stupified; but Mercury himself coming near,
taking the old man’s hand, interrogated, and addressed him:</p>
<p>“Whither, O father, dost thou this way direct thy horses and mules
during the ambrosial night, when other mortals are asleep? Dost thou not
fear the valour-breathing Greeks, who, enemies and hostile to thee, are
at hand? If any one of these should see thee in the dark and dangerous
night, bearing off so many valuables, what intention would then be
towards thee? Neither art thou young thyself, and this [is] an old man
who accompanies thee, to repel a warrior when first any may molest
thee. But I will not do thee injury, but will avert another from thee,
for I think thee like my dear father.”</p>
<p>But him Priam, the godlike old man, then answered:</p>
<p>“Surely these things are as thou sayest, my dear son. But hitherto some
one of the gods has protected me with his hand, who has sent such a
favourable conductor to meet me, so beautiful art thou in form and
appearance. And thou art also prudent in mind, and of blessed parents.”
But him again the messenger, the slayer of Argus, addressed: “O old man,
thou hast certainly spoken all these things with propriety. But come,
tell me this, and relate it truly; whither now dost thou send so many
and such valuable treasures amongst foreigners? Whether that these, at
least, may remain safe to thee? Or do ye all, now fearing, desert sacred
Ilium? For so brave a hero, was he who died, thy son; he was not in
aught inferior to the Greeks in battle.”</p>
<p>But him Priam, the godlike old man, then answered:</p>
<p>“But who art thou, O best one, and of what parents art thou, who
speakest so honourably to me of the death of my luckless son?”</p>
<p>But him again the messenger, the slayer of Argus, addressed:</p>
<p>“Thou triest me, old man. and inquirest concerning noble Hector; whom I,
indeed, have very often beheld with mine eyes in the glorious fight,
when, routing the Greeks, he slew them at their ships, destroying [them]
with his sharp spear; but we, standing, marvelled; for Achilles, enraged
with the son of Atreus, did not permit us to fight. But I am his
attendant, and the same well-made vessel brought us. I am [one] of the
Myrmidons; Polyetor is my father, who, indeed, is rich, but now old as
thou. To him there are six sons, but I am his seventh; with whom casting
lots, the lot occurred to me to follow [Achilles] hither. And I came to
the plain from the ships, for at dawn the rolling-eyed Greeks will raise
a fight around the city. For they are indignant sitting quiet, nor can
the chiefs of the Greeks restrain them, longing for war.”</p>
<p>But him then Priam, the godlike old man, answered:</p>
<p>“If indeed thou art one of the servants of Achilles, the son of Peleus,
come now, tell all the truth to me, whether is my son still at the
ships, or has Achilles, tearing him limb from limb, cast him to the
dogs?”</p>
<p>But him the messenger, the slayer of Argus, again addressed:</p>
<p>“O old man, neither have the dogs yet devoured him, nor the birds, but
he still lies at the ship of Achilles, in the same plight as before, at
his tents; and it is [now] the twelfth morning him lying, yet his body
is not at all putrid, nor do the worms devour him, which consume men
slain in battle. Doubtless he will drag him cruelly around the tomb of
his dear companion when divine morn appears; but he does not defile him.

part. But all his wounds are closed, whatever were inflicted; for many
thrust a spear into him. Thus do the happy gods regard thy son, though
dead; for he was dear to them in their heart.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but the old man rejoiced, and answered in words:</p>
<p>“O son, surely it is good to give due gifts to the immortals, for my
son, while he was yet in being, never neglected the gods who possess
Olympus, in his palace; therefore are they mindful of him, although in
the fate of death. But come now, accept from me this beautiful goblet;

[being] younger; nor wilt thou now persuade me; thou who orderest me to
accept thy gifts unknown to Achilles; whom indeed I dread, and scruple
in my heart to plunder, lest some evil should afterwards come upon me.
Yet would I go as a conductor to thee even to renowned Argos,
sedulously, in a swift ship, or accompanying thee on foot; nor, indeed,
would any one contend with thee, despising thy guide.”</p>
<p>Mercury spoke, and, leaping upon the chariot and horses, quickly took
the scourge and the reins in his hands, and breathed bold vigour into
the horses and mules. But when they had now reached the ramparts and
trench of the ships, then the guards were just employed about their
feast, and the messenger, the slayer of Argus, poured sleep upon them
all; and immediately he opened the gates and pushed back the bars, and
led in Priam, and the splendid gifts upon the car. But when they reached
the lofty tent of Achilles which the Myrmidons had reared for their
king, lopping fir timbers; and they roofed it over with a thatched roof,
mowing it from the mead, and made a great fence around, with thick-set
stakes, for their king: one bar only of fir held the door, which,
indeed, three Greeks used to fasten, and three used to open the great
fastening of the gates; but Achilles even alone used to shoot it. Then,
indeed, profitable Mercury opened it for the old man, and led in the
splendid presents to swift-footed Achilles; then he descended to the
ground, from the chariot, and said:</p>
<p>“O old man, I indeed come, an immortal god, Mercury, to thee; for to
thee my father sent me as companion. Yet shall I return indeed, nor be
present before the eyes of Achilles; for it would indeed be invidious
for an immortal god so openly to aid mortals. But do thou, entering,
clasp the knees of the son of Peleus, and supplicate him by his father,
and fair-haired mother, and his son; that thou mayest effect his mind.”</p>
<p>Thus, indeed, having spoken, Mercury went to lofty Olympus; and Priam
leaped from his chariot to the ground, and left Idæus there: but he
remained, guarding the steeds and mules; while the old man went straight
into the tent, where Achilles, dear to Jove, was sitting. Himself he
found within; but his companions sat apart; but two alone, the hero
Automedon, and Alcimus, a branch of Mars, standing near, were
ministering to him (for, eating and drinking, he had just ceased from
food, and the table still remained); but great Priam, entering, escaped
his notice, and, standing near, he clasped the knees of Achilles with
his hands, and kissed his dreadful man-slaughtering hands, which had
slain many sons to him. And as when a dread sense of guilt has seized a
man, who, having killed a man in his own country, comes to another
people, to [the abode of] some wealthy man,<span id="footnotetag792"/>

others also wondered, and looked at one another. And Priam,
supplicating, spoke [this] speech:</p>

<p>“Remember thy own father, O Achilles, like unto the gods, of equal age
with me, upon the sad threshold of old age. And perhaps indeed his
neighbours around are perplexing him, nor is there any one to ward off
war and destruction. Yet he indeed, hearing of thee being alive, both
rejoices in his mind, and every day expects to see his dear son returned
from Troy. But I [am] every way unhappy, for I begat the bravest sons in
wide Troy, of whom I say that none are left. Fifty there were to me,
when the sons of the Greeks arrived; nineteen indeed from one womb, but
the others women bore to me in my palaces. And of the greater number
fierce Mars indeed has relaxed the knees under them; but Hector, who was
my favourite,<span id="footnotetag793"/>

slain, fighting for his country; on account of whom I now come to the
ships of the Greeks, and bring countless ransoms, in order to redeem him
from thee. But revere the gods, O Achilles, and have pity on myself,
remembering thy father; for I am even more miserable, for I have endured
what no other earthly mortal [has], to put to my mouth the hand of a
man, the slayer of my son.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but in him he excited the desire of mourning for his
father; and taking him by the hand, he gently pushed the old man from
him. But they indeed, calling to mind, the one<span id="footnotetag794"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-24.htm.html#footnote794" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">794</sup></a> wept copiously [for]
man-slaughtering Hector, rolling [on the ground] before the feet of
Achilles; but Achilles bewailed his father, and again in turn Patroclus;
and their lamentation was aroused throughout the house. But when noble
Achilles had satiated himself with grief, and the desire [for weeping]
had departed from his heart and limbs, immediately rising from his seat,
he lifted up the old man with his hand, compassionating both his hoary
head and hoary chin; and, addressing him, spoke winged words:</p>

he ruled over the Myrmidons, and to him, being a mortal, they gave a

<p>But him Priam, the godlike old man, then, answered:</p>
<p>“Do not at all place me on a seat, Ο Jove-nurtured, whilst Hector lies
unburied in thy tents; but redeem him as soon as possible, that I may
behold him with mine eyes; and do thou receive the many ransoms which we
bring thee; and mayest thou enjoy them, and reach thy father-land, since
thou hast suffered me in the first place to live, and to behold the
light of the sun.”</p>
<p>But him swift-footed Achilles, sternly regarding, then addressed:</p>
<p>“Do not irritate me further, old man, for I also myself meditate
ransoming Hector to thee; for the mother who bore me, the daughter of
the marine old man, came as a messenger from Jove to me. And I perceive
thee also, O Priam, in my mind, nor do thou deceive me, that some one of
the gods has led thee to the swift ships of the Greeks; for a mortal
would not have dared to come into the camp, not even in very blooming
youth, for he could not have escaped the guards, nor indeed pushed back
the bars of our gates. Wherefore do not move my mind more to sorrows,
lest I leave thee not unharmed, old man, in my tents, though being a
suppliant, and violate the commands of Jove.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but the old man feared, and obeyed. But the son of Peleus
leaped forth, like a lion, from the door of the house, not alone; for
two attendants accompanied him, the hero Automedon, and Alcimus, whom
Achilles honoured most of his companions next after the deceased
Patroclus. These then unharnessed the horses and mules from the yoke,
and led in the clear-voiced herald of the old man, and placed him upon a
seat. They also took down from the well-polished car the countless
ransoms of Hector’s head. But they left two cloaks and a well-woven
tunic, in order that, having covered the body, he might give it to be
borne home. But having called his female attendants, he ordered them to
wash and anoint all round, taking it apart, that Priam might not see his
son; lest, seeing his son, he might not restrain the wrath in his
grieving heart, and might arouse the soul of Achilles, and he might slay
him, and violate the commands of Jove. But when the servants had washed
and anointed it with oil, they then threw over him a beautiful cloak,
and a tunic; then Achilles himself, having raised him up, placed him
upon a litter, and his companions, together with [him], lifted him upon
the well-polished chariot. But he moaned, and called upon his dear
companion by name:</p>
<p>“O Patroclus, be not wrathful with me, if thou shouldst hear, although
being in Hades, that I have ransomed noble Hector to his beloved father,
since he has not given me unworthy ransoms. Besides even of these will I
give thee a share, whatever is just.”</p>
<p>Noble Achilles spoke, and returned into the tent, and sat down upon a
well-made couch, whence he had risen, at the opposite wall, and
addressed Priam:</p>
<p>“Thy son is indeed redeemed to thee, as thou didst desire, and lies upon
a bier; and with the early dawn thou shalt behold him, conveying [him
away]: but now let us be mindful of the feast; for even fair-haired
Niobe was mindful of food, although twelve children perished in her
palaces, six daughters and six youthful sons; these indeed Apollo slew
with his silver bow, enraged with Niobe; but those, arrow-rejoicing
Diana, because, forsooth, she had compared herself with fair-cheeked
Latona. She said that [Latona] had borne [only] two, whereas she had
borne many; yet those, though being only two, destroyed all [her own].
Nine days indeed they lay in blood, nor was there any one to bury them,
for the son of Saturn had made the people stones; but upon the tenth day
the heavenly gods interred them. Still was she mindful of food, when she
was fatigued with weeping. Now, indeed, ever amidst the rocks, in the
desert mountains, in Sipylus, where, they say, the beds of the goddess
Nymphs are, who lead the dance around Acheloüs, there, although being a
stone, she broods over the sorrows [sent] from the gods. But come now, O
noble old man, let us likewise attend to food, but afterwards thou
mayest lament thy beloved son, conveying him into Troy; and he will be
bewailed by thee with many tears.”</p>
<p>Swift Achilles spoke, and leaping up, slew a white sheep, and his
companions flayed it well, and fitly dressed it; then they skilfully cut
it in pieces, pierced them with spits, roasted them diligently, and drew
them all off. Then Automedon, taking bread, distributed it over the
table in beautiful baskets; whilst Achilles helped the meat, and they
stretched out their hands to the prepared victuals lying before them.
But when they had dismissed the desire of food and drink, Dardanian
Priam indeed marvelled at Achilles, such and so great; for he was like
unto the gods; but Achilles marvelled at Dardanian Priam, seeing his
amiable countenance, and hearing his conversation. When, however, they
were satisfied with gazing at each other, him Priam, the godlike old
man, first addressed:</p>
<p>“Send me now to rest as soon as possible, Ο Jove-nurtured, that we,
reclining, may take our fill of sweet sleep; for never have these eyes
been closed beneath my eyelids from the time when my son lost his life
by thy hands; but I ever lament and cherish many woes, rolling in the
dust within the enclosures of my palaces. But now I have tasted food,
and poured sweet wine down my throat; for before indeed I had not tasted
it.”</p>
<p>He spoke; but Achilles ordered his companions, servants, and maids, to
place couches beneath the porch, and to spread beautiful purple mats on
them, and to strew embroidered carpets over them, and to lay on them
well-napped cloaks, to be drawn over all. But they went out of the hall,
having a torch in their hands, and hastening, they quickly spread two
couches. But the swift-footed Achilles, jocularly addressing him,<span id="footnotetag798"/>

Greeks come hither, who, sitting with me, constantly meditate plans, as
is just. If any of these should see thee in the dark and dangerous
night, he would forthwith tell Agamemnon, the shepherd of the people,
and perchance there would be a delay of the redemption of the body. But
come, tell me this, and tell it accurately: How many days dost thou
desire to perform the funeral rites of noble Hector, that I may myself
remain quiet so long, and restrain the people?”</p>

<p>“If indeed thou desirest me to celebrate the funeral of noble Hector,
thus doing, O Achilles, thou dost surely gratify me. For thou knowest
how we are hemmed in within the city, and it is far to carry wood from
the mountain; and the Trojans greatly dread [to do so]. Nine days indeed
we would lament him in our halls, but on the tenth would bury him, and

him, and on the twelfth we will fight, if necessary.” But him
swift-footed Achilles again addressed:</p>
<p>“These things shall be to thee, O aged Priam, as thou desirest; for I
will prevent the fight as long a time as thou desirest.”</p>
<p>Thus having spoken, he grasped the right hand of the old man near the
wrist, lest he should fear in his mind. They indeed, the herald and
Priam, slept there in the porch of the house, having prudent counsels in
their mind; while Achilles slept in the interior of the well-built tent;
and beside him lay fair-cheeked Brisëis.</p>
<p>The other gods indeed and chariot-fighting men slept all night, subdued
by gentle slumber; but sleep seized not Mercury, the author of good,
revolving in his mind how he should convey away king Priam from the
ships, having escaped the notice of the sacred gate-keeper. Accordingly
he stood over his head, and addressed him:</p>
<p>“O aged man, certainly evil is not at all a care to thee, that thou
sleepest thus amongst hostile men, after Achilles has suffered thee. Now
indeed thou hast ransomed thy beloved son, and hast given much; but the
sons left behind by thee would give three times as many ransoms for thee
alive, if Agamemnon, the son of Atreus, should know of thy being here,
and all the Greeks should know of it.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but the old man feared, and awoke the herald. Then for
them Mercury yoked the horses and mules, and quickly drove them himself
through the camp, nor did any one perceive. But when they reached the
course of the fair-flowing river, eddying Xanthus, which immortal Jove
begat, then indeed Mercury went away to lofty Olympus; and saffron-robed
Morn was diffused over the whole earth. They indeed drove the horses
towards the city with wailing and lamentation, and the mules bore the
body; nor did any other of the men and well-girdled women previously
perceive it; but Cassandra, like unto golden Venus, ascending Pergamus,
discovered her dear father standing in the driving-seat, and the
city-summoning herald. She beheld him also upon the mules, lying on the
litter; then indeed she shrieked, and cried aloud throughout the whole
city:</p>
<p>“O Trojans and Trojan women, going forth, behold Hector, if ever ye
rejoiced at his returning alive from battle; for he was a great joy to
the city, and to the whole people.”</p>
<p>Thus she spoke; nor was there any man left in the city, nor woman; for
insupportable grief came upon them all, and they met him near the gates
bringing in the body. But his wife and venerable mother first rushing to
the well-wheeled chariot, plucked out their hair, touching his head; and
the crowd stood around, weeping. And they indeed would have wept the
whole day till sunset before the gates, lamenting Hector, had not the
old man addressed the people from his chariot:</p>
<p>“Give way to me, to pass through with the mules; but afterwards shall ye
be satiated with weeping, after I shall carry him home.” Thus he spoke;
but they stood off, and made way for the chariot. But when they had
brought him into the illustrious palace, they laid him upon perforated
beds, and placed singers beside him, leaders of the dirges, who indeed
sang a mournful ditty, while the women also uttered responsive groans.
And amongst them white-armed Andromache began the lamentation, holding
the head of man-slaughtering Hector between her hands:</p>
<p>“O husband, young in years hast thou died, and hast left me a widow in
the palace. And besides, thy son is thus an infant, to whom thou and I,
ill-fated, gave birth; nor do I think he will attain to puberty; for
before that, this city will be overthrown from its summit. Certainly
thou, the protector, art dead, who didst defend its very self, and didst
protect its venerable wives and infant children; who will soon be
carried away in the hollow ships, and I indeed amongst them. But thou, O
my son, wilt either accompany me, where thou shalt labour unworthy
tasks, toiling for a merciless lord; or some one of the Greeks, enraged,
seizing thee by the hand, will hurl thee from a tower, to sad
destruction; to whom doubtless Hector has slain a brother, or a father,
or even a son; for by the hands of Hector very many Greeks have grasped
the immense earth with their teeth. For thy father was not gentle in the
sad conflict; wherefore indeed the people lament him throughout the
city. But thou hast caused unutterable grief and sorrow to thy parents,
O Hector, but chiefly to me are bitter sorrows left. For thou didst not
stretch out thy hands to me from the couch when dying; nor speak any
prudent word [of solace], which I might for ever remember, shedding
tears night and day.”</p>
<p>Thus she spoke, bewailing; but the women also lamented; and to them in
turn Hecuba began her vehement lamentation:</p>
<p>“O Hector, far of all my sons dearest to my soul, certainly being alive
to me, thou wert beloved by the gods, who truly have had a care of thee,
even in the destiny of death. For swift-footed Achilles sold<span id="footnotetag799"/>

other sons, whomsoever he seized, beyond the unfruitful sea, at Samos,
Imbrus, and Lemnos without a harbour. But when he had taken away thy
life with his long-bladed spear, he often dragged thee round the tomb of
his comrade Patroclus, whom thou slewest; but he did not thus raise him
up. But now thou liest, to my sorrow, in the palaces, fresh<span id="footnotetag800"/>

with his mild weapons.”</p>

<p>Thus she spoke, weeping; and aroused a vehement lamentation. But to them
Helen then, the third, began her lamentation:</p>
<p>“O Hector, far dearest to my soul of all my brothers-in-law, for godlike
Alexander is my husband, he who brought me to Troy:—would that I had
perished first. But now already this is the twentieth year to me from
the time when I came from thence, and quitted my native land; yet have I
never heard from thee a harsh or reproachful word; but if any other of
my brothers-in-law, or sisters-in-law, or well-attired husband’s
brothers’ wives, reproached me in the palaces, or my mother-in-law (for
my father-in-law was ever gentle as a father), then thou, admonishing
him with words, didst restrain him, both by thy gentleness and thy
gentle words. So that, grieved at heart, I bewail at the same time thee
and myself, unhappy; for there is not any other in wide Troy kind and
friendly to me; but all abhor me.”</p>
<p>Thus she spoke, weeping; and again the countless throng groaned. And
aged Priam spoke [this] speech amongst the people:</p>
<p>“O Trojans, now bring wood to the city, nor at all fear in your mind a
close ambuscade of the Greeks; for Achilles, dismissing me from the dark
ships, thus promised me, that he would not commence hostilities, before
the twelfth morning should arrive.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; and they yoked both oxen and mules beneath the waggons;
and then assembled before the city. For nine days indeed they brought
together an immense quantity of wood; but when now the tenth morn,
bearing light to mortals, had appeared, then indeed, weeping, they
carried out noble Hector, and placed the body on the lofty pile, and
cast in the fire.</p>
<p>But when the mother of dawn, rosy-fingered Morn, appeared, then were the
people assembled round the pile of illustrious Hector. But after they
were assembled, and collected together, first indeed they extinguished
all the pyre with dark wine, as much as the force of the fire had
possessed; but then his brothers and companions collected his white
bones, weeping, and the abundant tear streamed down their cheeks. And,
taking them, they placed them in a golden urn, covering them with soft
purple robes, and forthwith deposited it in a hollow grave; and then
strewed it above with numerous great stones. But they built up the tomb
in haste, and watches sat around on every side, lest the well-greaved
Greeks should make an attack too soon. And having heaped up the tomb,
they returned; and then being assembled together in order, they feasted
on a splendid banquet in the palaces of Priam, the Jove-nurtured king.</p>
<p>Thus indeed they performed the funeral of steed-breaking Hector.</p>
