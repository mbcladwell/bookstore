<h2>BOOK THE THIRD</h2>
<h4 id="pgepubid00012">ARGUMENT.</h4>
<p>Just as the armies are on the point of engaging, Paris proposes a single
combat, but, on Menelaus advancing, retires in affright. Being rebuked
by Hector, he consents to engage Menelaus, and a treaty is arranged.
Paris is vanquished, but is brought back safe to Ilium by Venus, who
appeases the anger of Helen. Menelaus, as conqueror, calls upon the
Trojans to fulfil the conditions of the challenge.</p>
<p class="p2">
But after they had each been marshalled along with their leaders, the
Trojans, on the one hand, moved along with both clamour and
battle-shout, like birds; just as is the noise of cranes forth under
heaven, which, after they have escaped the winter and immeasurable<span id="footnotetag144"/>

the ocean, bearing slaughter and fate to the Pygmæan men; and they then
at early dawn bring fatal strife. But the Greeks, on the other hand,

<p>As when the south wind sheds a mist over the top of a mountain, by no
means friendly to the shepherds, but more serviceable even than night
to the robber, and one can see [only] so far as he hurls a stone. So
under the feet of them proceeding an eddying dust kept rising: and very
speedily they traversed the plain.</p>
<p>But when they now were near, approaching each other, godlike Alexander
advanced in front of the Trojans, having a panther’s skin on his
shoulders, and his crooked bow, and a sword; but he brandishing two
spears tipped with brass, challenged all the bravest of the Greeks to
fight against him in grievous conflict.</p>
<p>But when Mars-beloved Menelaus perceived him advancing before the host,
taking long strides, as a hungering lion exults, when happening on a
carcase of large size, having found either a horned stag or a wild goat.
For he greedily devours it, although swift hounds and vigorous youths
pursue him. Thus Menelaus rejoiced, having beheld with his eyes godlike
Alexander. For he thought he would be revenged upon the guilty wretch:
forthwith, therefore, with his arms he leaped from his chariot to the
earth.</p>
<p>But when, therefore, godlike Alexander perceived him appearing among the
foremost warriors, he was smitten in his heart, and gave way back into
the band of his companions, avoiding death. And as when any one having
seen a serpent in the thickets of a mountain, has started back, and
tremor has seized his limbs under him, and he has retired backwards, and
paleness seizes his cheeks: thus godlike Alexander shrank back into the
band of the haughty Trojans, dreading the son of Atreus.</p>
<p>But Hector having seen him, upbraided him with opprobrious words:
“Cursed Paris,<span id="footnotetag146"/>

would that thou hadst either not been born, or that thou hadst perished
unmarried. This, indeed, I would wish, and indeed it would be much
better, than that thou shouldst thus be a disgrace and scandal to
others. In truth the long-haired Achæans may laugh, having suspected
that thou wast a noble champion, because a fine person belongs [to
thee]; but there is not strength in thy soul, nor any nerve. Didst thou,
being such a one, having sailed over the ocean in sea-traversing ships,
having collected congenial associates, and mingled with foreigners, take
away a beauteous lady, from the Apian land, the spouse of martial men, a
great detriment to thy father, to the city, and to all the people; a joy
indeed to our enemies, but a disgrace to thyself? Couldst thou not have
awaited warlike Menelaus? Then shouldst thou have known of how brave a
man thou dost possess the blooming spouse. Nor will thy harp, and the
gifts of Venus, and thy hair, and thy figure avail thee, when thou shalt
be mingled with the dust.<span id="footnotetag147"/>

<p>Him then godlike Alexander in turn addressed: “Hector, since thou hast
reproached me justly, and not unjustly, [I will submit]. Ever is thy
spirit unwearied, like an axe, which penetrates the wood, [driven] by
the man who with art cuts out the naval plank, and it increases the
force of the man: so in thy breast is there an intrepid heart. Reproach
me not with the lovely gifts of golden Venus: the distinguished gifts of
the gods are by no means to be rejected, whatever indeed they give; for
no one can choose them at his own pleasure. Now, however, if thou
desirest me to wage war and to fight, cause the other Trojans and all
the Greeks to sit down, but match me and Mars-beloved Menelaus to
contend in the midst for Helen and all the treasures. And whichever of
us shall conquer, and shall be superior, having received all the
treasures without reserve, and the woman, let him conduct them home. But
let the rest of you, striking a friendship and faithful league, inhabit
fertile Troy; and let them return to the steed-nourishing Argos, and
fair-damed Achaia.”</p>

<p>Thus he spoke, but Hector on the other hand rejoiced greatly, having
heard his speech; and having advanced into the centre, holding his spear
by the middle, he restrained the phalanxes of the Trojans, and they all
sat down. Against him the waving-haired Achæans were directing their
bows, and taking aim, were going to hurl with shafts and with stones.
But Agamemnon, he,<span id="footnotetag149"/>

<p>“Withhold, Argives! cast not, ye sons of the Aenæans; for helm-nodding
Hector stands as if intending to propose something.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but they abstained from battle, and instantly became
silent. But Hector between both [armies] spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Hear from me, ye Trojans, and well-greaved Greeks, the proposal of
Alexander, on whose account this strife has arisen. He advises that the
other Trojans and all the Greeks should lay down their beauteous arms
upon the bounteous earth; but that he and Mars-beloved Menelaus alone
should fight in the midst for Helen and all the treasures; and whichever
shall conquer, and shall be superior, having received all the treasures
without reserve, and the woman, let him conduct them home: but let the
rest of us strike a friendship and faithful league.”</p>
<p>Thus he said, and all became mute in silence. But amidst them Menelaus,
valiant in the din of war, thus spoke:</p>
<p>“Now hear me also; for anguish has invaded my soul most: but I purpose
that the Greeks and Trojans should now be separated, since ye have
suffered many evils on account of my quarrel and the beginning of [this
strife through] Alexander. And to whichever of us death and fate has
been ordained, let him die; but do the rest of you be very speedily
separated. And bring lambs—one white, the other black—to the Earth and
to the Sun; and we will bring another to Jove. Moreover ye shall bring
the might of Priam, that he may strike the league himself, for his sons
are overbearing and faithless; lest any one, by transgression, violate
the covenant of Jove. For the minds of younger men are ever fluctuating;
but for those among whom a senior is present, he looks at the same time
both backward and forward, in order that the best results may accrue to
both parties.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke. But both Greeks and Trojans rejoiced, hoping to have
respite from grievous war. And they accordingly reined back their horses
to the ranks [of the foot], but dismounted themselves, and put off
their arms, and laid them down on the ground near each other; and around
[each pile of arms] there was a little space.</p>
<p>But Hector despatched two heralds to the city with speed, to bring the
lambs, and to call Priam. While, on the other hand, king Agamemnon sent
Talthybius to go to the hollow ships, and ordered him to bring a lamb.
And he did not disobey noble Agamemnon.</p>
<p>And meantime came Iris a messenger to white-armed Helen, likening
herself to her husband’s sister, the wife of Antenor’s son, most
excelling in beauty of the daughters of Priam, Laodice, whom the son of
Antenor, king Helicaon, possessed. But she found her in her palace, and
she was weaving an ample web, a double [mantle],<span id="footnotetag150"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-3.htm.html#footnote150" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">150</sup></a> resplendent, and
on it was working many labours both of the horse-taming Trojans and the
brazen-mailed Greeks, which on her account they suffered at the hands of
Mars. Standing near, the swift-footed Iris accosted her thus:</p>
<p>“Come hither, dear lady,<span id="footnotetag151"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-3.htm.html#footnote151" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">151</sup></a> that thou mayest view the wondrous deeds
of the horse-taming Trojans, and of the brazen-mailed Greeks, who
formerly against each other waged tearful war in the plain, eager for
destructive battle. Now, however, they sit in silence (and the war has
ceased), leaning on their shields, and near them their long spears are
fixed. But Alexander and Mars-beloved Menelaus are about to fight for
thy sake with their long spears, and thou shalt be called the dear wife
of him who conquers.”</p>
<p>Thus having spoken, the goddess infused a tender desire into her mind
both of her former husband, and of her city, and her parents. And
instantly veiling herself in white linen robes,<span id="footnotetag152"/>

chamber, shedding a tender tear: not alone, for two domestics
accompanied her, Œthra, daughter of Pittheus, and large-eyed Clymene.
Then they quickly came to where the Scæan gates were. But Priam and
Panthous, and Thymœtes, Lampus, Clytius, Hicetaon, an offshoot of Mars,
Ucalegon, and Antenor, both prudent, elders of the people, sat at the
Scæan gates, long since desisting from war, through old age: but good

<p>“It is not a subject for indignation, that Trojans and well-greaved
Greeks endure hardships for a long time on account of such a woman. In
countenance she is wondrous like unto the immortal goddess, but even so,
although being such, let her return in the ships, nor be left a
destruction to us and to our children hereafter.”</p>
<p>Thus they spoke. But Priam called Helen,—“Coming hither before us, dear
daughter, sit by me, that thou mayest see thy former husband, thy
kindred, and thy friends—(thou art not at all in fault towards me; the
gods, in truth, are in fault towards me, who have sent against me the
lamentable war of the Greeks)—that thou mayest name for me this mighty
man, who is this gallant and tall Grecian hero. Certainly there are
others taller in height; but so graceful a man have I never yet beheld
with my eyes, nor so venerable; for he is like unto a kingly man.”</p>
<p>But him Helen, one of the divine women, answered in [these] words:
“Revered art thou and feared by me, dear father-in-law; would that an
evil death had pleased me, when I followed thy son hither, having left
my marriage-bed, my brothers, my darling<span id="footnotetag154"/>

<p>Thus she spoke. But him the old man admired, and said “O blessed son of
Atreus, happy-born, fortunate, truly indeed were many Achæan youths made
subject to thee. Before now I entered vine-bearing Phrygia, where I
beheld many Phrygians, heroes on fleet horses, the forces of Otreus and
godlike Mygdon, who encamped there near the banks of the Sangarius. For
I also, being an ally, was numbered with them on that day, when the
man-opposing Amazons came. But not even these were so numerous as the
black-eyed Greeks.”</p>

   it out.</p>
<p>But him Helen, sprung from Jove, answered: “Now, this one again is the
son of Laertes, much-scheming Ulysses, who was bred in the country of
Ithaca, rugged though it be, skilled in all kinds of stratagems and
prudent counsels.”</p>
<p>Her then the sage Antenor addressed in reply: “O lady, assuredly hast
thou spoken this word very truly: for already in former times divine
Ulysses came hither also, on an embassy concerning thee, with
Mars-beloved Menelaus. I received them as guests, and entertained them
in my palace, and became acquainted with the genius of both, and their
prudent counsels; but when they were mingled with the assembled Trojans,
Menelaus indeed overtopped him, as they stood by his broad shoulders;
but when both were sitting, Ulysses was more majestic.<span id="footnotetag159"/>

they began to weave words and counsels for all, Menelaus, on his part,
would harangue very fluently; a few [words] indeed, but very sweetly,
since he was not loquacious, nor a random talker, though he was younger
in age. But when much-counselling Ulysses arose, he stood and looked
down, fixing his eyes on the earth, but he neither moved his sceptre
backwards nor forwards, but held it unmoved like an unskilful man: you
would say indeed that he was a very irritable man, as well as devoid of
reason. But when he did send forth the mighty voice from his breast, and
words like unto wintry flakes of snow, no longer then would another
mortal contend with Ulysses. And beholding, we then marvelled not so
much at the aspect of Ulysses, [as at his words].”</p>

<p>Then in the third place, having beheld Ajax, the old man asked: “Who is
that other Achæan hero, valiant and great, out-topping the Argives by
his head and broad shoulders?”</p>
<p>But him long-robed Helen answered, divine of women: “This indeed is
mighty Ajax, the bulwark of the Achæans: on the other side, amongst the
Cretans, stands Idomeneus like unto a god: but around him the leaders of
the Cretans are collected. Often did Mars-beloved Menelaus entertain him
in our palace, when he would come from Crete. But now I behold all the
other rolling-eyed Greeks, whom I could easily recognize, and pronounce
their names; but two leaders of the people I cannot see: horse-taming
Castor, and Pollux skilled in boxing, twin brothers, whom the same
mother brought forth with me. Either they have not followed from
pleasant Lacedæmon, or they indeed have followed hither in the
sea-traversing ships, but now are reluctant to enter the fight of the
heroes, fearing the disgrace, and the many reproaches which are mine.”</p>

<p>But heralds through the city were bearing the firm pledges of the gods,
two lambs and joyous wine, the fruit of the earth, in a goat-skin
flagon. But the herald Idæus also brought a splendid goblet, and golden
cups; and standing by him, incited the old man in these words:</p>
<p>“Arise, son of Laomedon; the chiefs of the horse-breaking Trojans, and
of the brazen-mailed Greeks, call thee to descend into the plain, that
thou mayest ratify a faithful league. For Alexander and Mars-beloved
Menelaus are about to fight with long spears for the woman. But let the
woman and the effects attend the conqueror; but let the rest of us,
having struck a friendship and faithful league, inhabit fruitful Troy,
and they shall return to horse-feeding Argos, and to Achaia, famed for
fair dames.”</p>
<p>Thus he said, but the old man shuddered, and ordered his attendants to
yoke his horses; and they briskly obeyed. Priam then mounted his
chariot, and drew back the reins: and beside him Antenor mounted the
beautiful chariot. So they guided their fleet steeds through the Scæan
gates, towards the plain.</p>
<p>But when they had now come between the Trojans and the Greeks,
descending from their steeds to the fruitful earth, they advanced into
the midst of the Trojans and Greeks. Then Agamemnon, king of heroes,
immediately arose, and much-counselling Ulysses arose. But the
illustrious heralds collected together the faithful pledges of the gods,
and mixed wine in a bowl, and poured water upon the hands of the kings.
And the son of Atreus, drawing with his hands his dagger, which was
always suspended at the huge sheath of his sword, cut off hairs from the
heads of the lambs: and then the heralds distributed them to the chiefs
of the Trojans and the Greeks. Amongst them the son of Atreus prayed
earnestly, having stretched forth his hands:</p>
<p>“O father Jove, ruling from Ida, most glorious, most mighty,—and thou,
O sun, who beholdest all things, and nearest all things—and ye rivers,
and thou earth, and ye below who punish men deceased, whosoever swears
with perjury, be ye witnesses and preserve the faithful league. If, on
the one hand, Alexander should slay Menelaus, let him thenceforth retain
Helen and all her possessions; but let us return in our sea-traversing
ships. But if, on the contrary, yellow-haired Menelaus slay Alexander,
let the Trojans then restore Helen and all her treasures, and pay a fine
to the Argives such as is just, and which may be [recorded] amongst
posterity. But if Priam and the sons of Priam will not pay me the fine,
on Alexander falling, then will I afterwards fight on account of the
fine, remaining here till I find an end of the war.”</p>
<p>He spoke, and cut the throats of the lambs with the cruel steel, and he
laid them on the earth panting, wanting life; for the brass had taken
away their [vital] strength. Then having drawn wine from the goblet,
they poured it into the cups, and prayed to the immortal gods. But thus
some one of the Greeks and Trojans said:</p>
<p>“Ο Jove, most glorious, most mighty, and ye other immortal gods, whoever
first shall offend against the leagues, so let the brain of themselves
and of their children stream upon the ground like this wine, and let
their wives be mingled with other men.”</p>
<p>Thus they said, nor yet did the son of Saturn ratify [their vows]. Then
Priam, the son of Dardanus, addressed them:</p>
<p>“Hear me, ye Trojans, and ye well-greaved Greeks: I, indeed, return
again to wind-swept Ilion, since I can by no means endure to behold with
these eyes my dear son fighting with Mars-beloved Menelaus. Jove,
certainly, knows this, and the other immortal gods, to which of them the
event of death is destined.”</p>
<p>He spoke, and the godlike man placed the lambs in the chariot, and
ascended himself, and drew back the reins; and beside him Antenor
mounted the very beautiful chariot. They on their part returning went
back towards Ilion.</p>
<p>But Hector on the other hand, the son of Priam, and divine Ulysses,
first measured the ground; then taking the lots, they shook them in the
brazen helmet, [to decide] which should hurl the brazen spear first. But
the people meantime supplicated, and stretched forth their hands to the
gods; and thus some one of the Greeks and Trojans said:</p>
<p>“O father Jove, ruling from Ida, most glorious, most mighty, whichever
has caused these evil works to both sides, grant that he, being slain,
may enter the house of Pluto, but that to us, on the other hand, there
may be friendship and a faithful league.”</p>
<p>Thus then they spoke, and now mighty helm-quivering Hector shook the
lots, looking backward; and quickly the lot of Paris leaped forth. They
then sat down in their ranks, where the fleet steeds of each stood, and
their varied arms lay. But divine Alexander, the husband of fair-haired
Helen, put on his beauteous armour around his shoulders. In the first
place, around his legs he placed his beautiful greaves fitted with
silver clasps; then again he put on his breast the corslet of his
brother Lycaon, for it fitted him; but around his shoulders he slung his
brazen, silver-studded sword and then his huge and solid shield. But on
his valiant head he placed a well-wrought helmet, crested with
horse-hair, and the crest nodded dreadfully from above; and he grasped
his doughty spear, which fitted to his hands. In this same manner the
martial Menelaus put on his arms.</p>
<p>
But they, when they were armed from each side of the throng, advanced to the
middle between the Trojans and Greeks, looking dreadfully; and amazement seized
the beholders, both the horse-breaking Trojans and the well-greaved Greeks.
They then stood near in the measured-out space, brandishing their spears,
incensed against each other. Alexander first hurled his long-shadowed spear,
and smote the shield of the son of Atreus, equal on all sides, nor did the
brass break, for the point was bent upon the strong shield: but next Menelaus,
son of Atreus, commenced the attack with his brazen spear, praying to father
Jove:
</p>
<p>“O king Jove, grant [me] to avenge myself [on him] who first injured me,
and subdue impious Alexander under my hands, that every one, even of
future men, may shudder to offer injury to a guest who may have afforded
[him] an hospitable reception.”</p>
<p>He spoke; and brandishing, he hurled his long-shadowed spear, and smote
the shield of the son of Priam, equal on all sides; and through the
glittering shield went the impetuous spear, and was stuck firmly into
the deftly-wrought corslet: and the spear pierced right through his soft
tunic beside the flank: but he bent sideways, and evaded black death.
Next the son of Atreus having drawn his silver-studded sword, raising
it, struck the cone<span id="footnotetag161"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-3.htm.html#footnote161" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">161</sup></a> of his helmet, but it fell from his hand
shivered round about into three or four pieces. And the son of Atreus
groaned aloud, looking towards the wide heaven:</p>

<p>“Ο father Jove, none other of the gods is more baleful than thou.
Certainly I hoped to be revenged upon Alexander for his wickedness: but
now my sword has been broken in my hands, and my spear has been hurled
from my hand in vain, nor have I smote him.”</p>
<p>He spoke; and rushing on, he seized him by the horse-hair tufted helmet,
and turning, began to drag him to the well-greaved Greeks: but the
richly-embroidered band under his tender throat was choking him, which
was drawn under his chin as the strap of his helmet. And now he had
dragged him away, and obtained infinite glory, had not Venus, the
daughter of Jove, quickly perceived it, who broke for him <span id="footnotetag162"/>

thong, [made] from the hide of an ox slaughtered by violence: and
thereupon the empty helmet followed with his strong hand. It, then, the
hero whirling round, cast to the well-greaved Greeks, and his dear
companions took it up. And he [Menelaus] again rushed on, desiring to
slay him with his brazen spear: but him [Paris] Venus very easily, as
being a goddess, rescued, and covered him in a thick mist; then placed
him down in his fragrant chamber, exhaling perfumes.</p>

<p>But she herself, on the other hand, went to call Helen, and she found
her on the lofty tower, and many Trojan dames around her. Then with her
hand catching her by the fragrant mantle, she shook her: and likening
herself to an ancient dame, a spinner of wool, who used to comb fair
wool for her when dwelling at Lacedæmon, and she loved her much: to her
having likened herself, divine Venus accosted [Helen]:</p>
<p>“Come hither, Alexander calls thee to return home. He himself is in his
chamber and turned bed, shining both in beauty and attire; nor wouldst
thou say that he had returned after having fought with a hero, but that
he was going to the dance, or that just ceasing from the dance, he sat
down.”</p>
<p>Thus she said, and agitated the heart in her breast: and when she beheld
the all-beauteous neck of the goddess, and her lovely bosom, and her
flashing eyes, she was awe-struck, and spoke a word, and said:</p>
<p>“Strange one! why dost thou desire to deceive me in these things? Wilt
thou lead me anywhere farther on to one of the well-inhabited cities,
either of Phrygia or pleasant Mæonia, if there be any of
articulately-speaking men dear to thee there? Is it because Menelaus,
having now conquered noble Alexander, wishes to bring hated me home,
that therefore with artful purpose thou now standest near me? Going,
sit with him thyself, and renounce the path of the gods. And mayest thou
no more return on thy feet to Olympus: but always grieve beside him, and
watch him, until he either make thee his consort, or he indeed [make
thee] his handmaid. But there I will not go to adorn his couch, for it
would be reprehensible: all the Trojan ladies henceforth will reproach
me. But I shall have woes without measure in my soul.”</p>
<p>But her, divine Venus, incensed, thus addressed: “Wretch, provoke me
not, lest in my wrath I abandon thee, and detest thee as much as
heretofore I have wonderfully loved thee, and lest I scatter destructive
hate in the midst of the Trojans and Greeks, and thou perish by an evil
fate.”</p>
<p>Thus she spoke: but Helen, sprung from Jove, dreaded, and she went
covered with a white transparent robe, in silence; and escaped the
notice of all the Trojan dames, for the goddess led the way.</p>
<p>But when they reached the very beautiful palace of Alexander, then the
maids, on their part, turned themselves speedily to their tasks; but
she, divine of women, ascended into her lofty-roofed chamber: and then
laughter-loving Venus, carrying, placed a seat for her opposite
Alexander: there Helen, daughter of the ægis-bearing Jove, sat, averting
her eyes, and reproached her husband with these words:</p>
<p>“Thou hast come from the war: would that thou hadst perished there,
slain by that brave hero, who was my former husband. Certainly, thou
didst formerly boast, that thou wast superior to Mars-beloved Menelaus,
in might, in hands, and at the spear. But go now, challenge Mars-beloved
Menelaus to fight once more against thee! But I advise thee to refrain,
nor unadvisedly wage war and fight against fair-haired Menelaus, lest
perchance thou mayest be subdued beneath his spear.”</p>
<p>But her Paris answering addressed in words: “Woman! assail me not in
soul with reproachful taunts; for now indeed has Menelaus conquered by
Minerva’s aid; but I in turn will vanquish him, for gods are with us
also. But come, let us delight in dalliance, reclining together, for
never before did love so fondly enwrap my soul, not even when formerly,
having borne thee away from pleasant Lacedæmon, I sailed in the
sea-traversing ships, and was united with thee in love and in the couch
in the island Cranaë; so now am I enamoured of thee, and sweet desire
possesses me.”</p>
<p>He spoke, and led the way, ascending the couch; but his wife followed
with him: they therefore rested upon their perforated couch.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the son of Atreus was wandering through the crowd like to a
savage beast, if anywhere he could perceive godlike Alexander. But none
of the Trojans or their illustrious allies could then point out
Alexander to Mars-beloved Menelaus; for neither through friendship would
they have concealed him, if any one did see him; for he was hateful to
them all, like sable death. But amongst them spoke Agamemnon, king of
heroes:</p>
<p>“Hear me, ye Trojans, Greeks, and allies: the victory indeed appears [to
belong to] Mars-beloved Menelaus. Do ye therefore restore Argive Helen
and her treasures with her, and pay the fine which is fitting, and which
shall be remembered by future men.”</p>
<p>Thus spoke the son of Atreus, and the other Greeks approved.</p>
