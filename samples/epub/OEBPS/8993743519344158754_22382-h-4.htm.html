<h2>BOOK THE FOURTH</h2>
<h4 id="pgepubid00014">ARGUMENT.</h4>
<p>Paris not being slain, the combat left it doubtful whether Helen should
be returned or not; but Juno extorts a promise from Jove of the final
destruction of Troy. Minerva then persuades Pandarus to break the truce
by aiming an arrow at Menelaus. The wound is, however, cured by Machaon.
The Trojans proceed to the battle, while Agamemnon exhorts the
chieftains of the Greeks. The fight then commences, Mars and Apollo
encouraging the Trojans, Minerva and the other deities the Greeks.</p>

<p>Thus he spoke: but Minerva and Juno murmured with closed lips, for they
were sitting near, and were devising evils for the Trojans. Minerva,
indeed, was silent, nor said anything, indignant with her father Jove,
for dreadful rage possessed her. But Juno could not retain her fury in
her breast, but addressed him:</p>
<p>“Most baleful son of Saturn! what a sentence hast thou uttered! How dost
thou wish to render my labour vain, and my sweat fruitless, which I have
sweated through with toil? For the steeds are tired to me assembling the
host, evils to Priam and to his sons. Do so: but all we the other gods
do not approve.”</p>
<p>But her cloud-compelling Jove, in great wrath, answered: “Strange one!
how now do Priam and the sons of Priam work so many wrongs against thee,
that thou desirest implacably to overturn the well-built city of Ilion?
But if thou, entering the gates and the lofty walls, couldst devour
alive<span id="footnotetag170"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-4.htm.html#footnote170" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">170</sup></a> Priam and the sons of Priam, and the other Trojans, then
perhaps thou mightst satiate thy fury. Do as thou wilt, lest this
contention be in future a great strife between thee and me. But another
thing I tell thee, and do thou lay it up in thy soul: whenever haply I,
anxiously desiring, shall wish to destroy some city, where men dear to
thee are born, retard not my rage, but suffer me; for I have given thee
this of free will, though with unwilling mind. For of those cities of
earthly men, which are situated under the sun and the starry heaven,
sacred Ilion was most honoured by me in my heart, and Priam and the
people of Priam skilled in the ashen spear. For there my altars never
lacked a due banquet and libation, and savour; for this honour were we
allotted.”</p>

<p>Him then the venerable full-eyed Juno answered: “There are three cities,
indeed, most dear to me: Argos, and Sparta, and wide-wayed Mycenæ;<span id="footnotetag171"/>

destroy these whenever they become hateful to thy soul. In behalf of
these I neither stand forth, nor do I grudge them to thee: for even
were I to grudge them, and not suffer thee to destroy them, by grudging
I avail nothing, since thou art much more powerful. And yet it becomes
[thee] to render my labour not fruitless; for I am a goddess, and thence
my race, whence thine; and wily Saturn begat me, very venerable on two
accounts, both by my parentage, and because I have been called thy
spouse. Moreover, thou rulest amongst all the immortals. But truly let
us make these concessions to each other: I, on my part, to thee, and
thou to me; and the other immortal gods will follow. Do thou without
delay bid Minerva go to the dreadful battle-din of the Trojans and
Greeks, and contrive that the Trojans may first begin to injure the most
renowned Greeks, contrary to the leagues.”</p>

(return) </a> “It certainly seems to me, that, in a reference so
   distinct to the three great Peloponnesian cities which the
   Dorians invaded and possessed, Homer makes as broad an allusion
   to the conquests of the Heraclidæ, not only as would be
   consistent with the pride of an Ionic Greek in attesting the
   triumphs of the national Dorian foe, but as the nature of a theme
   cast in a distant period, and remarkably removed, in its general
   conduct, from the historical detail of subsequent events, would
   warrant to the poet.”—Bulwer, Athens, i. 8. The correctness of
   this view, however, depends upon the true date of Homer’s
   existence.</p>
<p>Thus she spoke; nor did the father of gods and men disobey. Instantly he
addressed Minerva in winged words:</p>
<p>“Go very quickly to the army, among the Trojans and Greeks, and contrive
that the Trojans may first begin to injure the most renowned Greeks,
contrary to the league.”</p>
<p>Thus having spoken, he urged on Minerva already inclined; she hastening
descended the heights of Olympus; such as the star which the son of wily
Saturn sends, a sign either to mariners, or to a wide host of nations,
and from it many sparks are emitted. Like unto this Pallas Minerva
hastened to the earth, and leaped into the midst [of the army]; and
astonishment seized the horse-breaking Trojans and the well-greaved
Greeks, looking on. And thus would one say, looking at some other near
him:</p>
<p>“Doubtless evil war and dreadful battle-din will take place again, or
Jove is establishing friendship between both sides, he who has been
ordained the arbiter of war amongst men.” <span id="footnotetag172"/>

<p>Thus then did some one of the Greeks and Trojans say; but she like a
hero entered the host of the Trojans, the brave warrior Laodocus, son of
Antenor, seeking godlike Pandarus, if anywhere she might find him. She
found the blameless and valiant son of Lycaon standing, and around him
the brave ranks of shielded warriors, who had followed him from the
streams of Æsepus; and standing near, she thus to him spoke winged
words:</p>
<p>“Wouldst thou now hearken to me in anything, O warlike son of Lycaon?
Thou wouldst venture then to aim a swift arrow at Menelaus. Doubtless
thou wouldst bear away both thanks and glory from all the Trojans, but
of all, chiefly from the prince Alexander, from whom, indeed, first of
all, thou wouldst receive splendid gifts, if he should see martial
Menelaus, the son of Atreus, subdued by this weapon, ascending the sad

   given by the Scholiast, Hesychius, and others. But Heraclides,

   377.</p>
<p>Thus spoke Minerva, and she persuaded his mind for him, unthinking one.
Straightway he uncased his well-polished bow, made from [the horn of] a
wild, bounding goat, which he indeed surprising once on a time in
ambush, as it was coming out of a cavern, struck, aiming at it beneath
the breast; but it fell supine on the rock. Its horns had grown sixteen
palms from its head; and these the horn-polishing artist, having duly
prepared, fitted together, and when he had well smoothed all, added a
golden tip. And having bent the bow, he aptly lowered it, having
inclined it against the ground; but his excellent companions held their
shields before him, lest the martial sons of the Greeks should rise
against him, before warlike Menelaus, the chief of the Greeks, was
wounded. Then he drew off the cover of his quiver, and took out an
arrow, fresh, winged, a cause of gloomy ills. Forthwith he fitted the
bitter arrow to the string, and vowed to Lycian-born Apollo, the
renowned archer, that he would sacrifice a splendid hecatomb of
firstling lambs, having returned home to the city of sacred Zeleia.
Having seized them, he drew together the notch [of the arrow] and the
ox-hide string; the string, indeed, he brought near to his breast, and
the barb to the bow. But after he had bent the great bow into a circle,
the bow twanged, the bowstring rang loudly, and the sharp-pointed shaft
bounded forth, impatient to wing its flight through the host.</p>
<p>Nor did the blessed immortal gods forget thee, O Menelaus;<span id="footnotetag174"/>

chiefly the spoil-hunting daughter of Jove, who, standing before thee,
averted the deadly weapon. She as much repelled it from thy body, as a
mother repels a fly from her infant, when it shall have laid itself down
in sweet sleep. But she herself guided it to that part where the golden
clasps of the girdle bound it, and the double-formed corslet met.<span id="footnotetag175"/>

The bitter arrow fell on his well-fitted belt, and through the
deftly-wrought belt was it driven, and it stuck in the variegated
corslet and the brazen-plated belt which he wore, the main defence of
his body, a guard against weapons, which protect him most; through even
this did it pass onwards, and the arrow grazed the surface of the hero’s
skin, and straightway black gore flowed from the wound. And as when some
Mæonian<span id="footnotetag176"/>

cheek-trapping for steeds; in her chamber it lies, and many charioteers
desire to bear it, but it lies by as an ornament for the king, both as a
decoration to the steed, and a glory to the rider: so, Menelaus, were
thy well-proportioned thighs, and legs, and fair feet below, stained
with gore.</p>

   that “it is principally owing to our sense of the dramatic
   probability of the action of the divinities in the Iliad that the

   the manifest favourite of the gods stands out in a dilated and

flowing from the wound, and Mars-beloved Menelaus himself shuddered. But

once more collected in his breast. But Agamemnon, deeply sighing, and
holding Menelaus with his hand, spoke thus amidst them, and all his
companions kept groaning with him:</p>

<p>“Ο dear brother, now have I ratified a treaty which will prove thy
death, exposing thee alone to fight with the Trojans for the Greeks;
since the Trojans have thus wounded thee, and trampled on the faithful
league. But by no means shall the league and the blood of the lambs be
in vain, and the pure libations, and the right hands in which we
confided. For even although Olympian Jove has not immediately brought
them to pass, he will however bring them to pass at last; and at a great
price have they paid the penalty,<span id="footnotetag178"/>

their wives and children. For this I know well in mind and soul. A day
will be, when sacred Ilium shall perish, and Priam, and the people of
ashen-speared Priam; and when Saturnian Jove, lofty-throned, dwelling in
the æther, will himself shake his gloomy ægis over all, wrathful on
account of this treachery. These things, indeed, shall not be
unaccomplished; but to me there will be grief on thy account, O
Menelaus, if thou shalt die and fulfil the fate of life; then, indeed,
branded with shame, shall I return to much longed-for Argos. For quickly
the Greeks will bethink themselves of their fatherland, and we shall
leave Argive Helen a boast to Priam and to the Trojans, and the earth
will rot thy bones lying in Troy, near to an unfinished work. And thus
will some one of the haughty Trojans exclaim, leaping upon the tomb of
glorious Menelaus: ‘Would that Agamemnon thus wreaked his vengeance
against all, as even now he has led hither an army of the Greeks in
vain, and has now returned home into his dear native land, with empty
ships, having left behind him brave Menelaus.’ Thus will some one
hereafter say: then may the wide earth yawn for me.”</p>

   hour of retribution is so certain, that it may be considered

<p>But him fair-haired Menelaus accosted, cheering him: “Have courage, nor
in anywise frighten the people of the Achæans. The sharp arrow has not
stuck in a vital part, but before [it reached a vital part], the
variegated belt, and the girdle beneath, and the plate which
brass-working men forged, warded it off.”</p>
<p>King Agamemnon answering him replied: “Would that it were so, O beloved
Menelaus; but the physician shall probe the wound, and apply remedies,
which may ease thee of thy acute pains.”</p>
<p>He spoke; and thus accosted Talthybius, the divine herald: “Talthybius,
summon hither with all speed the hero Machaon, son of the blameless
physician Æsculapius, that he may see martial Menelaus, the chief of the
Greeks, whom some skilful archer of the Trojans, or of the Lycians, has
wounded with a shaft; a glory, indeed, to him, but a grief to us.”</p>
<p>He spoke; nor did the herald disobey when he had heard. But he proceeded
to go through the forces of the brazen-mailed Greeks, looking around for
the hero Machaon: him he saw standing, and round him the brave ranks of
the shield-bearing hosts, who followed him from steed-nourishing Tricca.
Standing near, he spoke winged words:</p>
<p>“Come, O son of Æsculapius, Agamemnon, king of men, calls thee, that
thou mayest see martial Menelaus, the son of Atreus, whom some skilful
archer of the Trojans or of the Lycians has wounded with a dart; a glory
indeed to him, but a grief to us.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, and incited his soul within his breast. And they
proceeded to go through the host, through the wide army of the Greeks;
but when they had now arrived where fair-haired Menelaus had been
wounded (but around him were collected as many as were bravest, in a
circle, while the godlike hero stood in the midst), instantly thereupon
he extracted the arrow from the well-fitted belt. But while it was being
extracted, the sharp barbs were broken. Then he loosed the variegated
belt, and the girdle beneath, and the plated belt which brass-workers
had forged. But when he perceived the wound, where the bitter shaft had
fallen, having sucked out the blood, he skilfully sprinkled on it
soothing remedies,<span id="footnotetag179"/>

<p>Whilst they were thus occupied around warlike Menelaus, meantime the
ranks of the shielded Trojans advanced; and these again put on their
arms, and were mindful of battle. Then would you not see divine
Agamemnon slumbering, nor trembling nor refusing to fight; but hastening
quickly to the glorious fight. He left his steeds, indeed, and his
brass-variegated chariot; and these his servant Eurymedon, son of
Ptolymæus, the son of Piräis, held apart panting. Him he strictly
enjoined to keep them near him, against the time when weariness should
seize his limbs, commanding over many. But he on foot traversed the
ranks of the heroes, and whichever of the swift-horsed Greeks he saw
hastening, them standing beside, he encouraged with words:</p>
<p>“Argives! remit nought of your fierce ardour, for father Jove will not
be an abettor to falsehoods, but certainly vultures will devour the
tender bodies of those very persons, who first offered injury, contrary
to the league; and we, after we shall have taken the city, will carry
off in our ships their dear wives, and their infant children.”</p>
<p>But whomsoever on the other hand he saw declining hateful battle, them
he much rebuked with angry words:</p>
<p>“Argives, ye arrow-fighters,<span id="footnotetag180"/>

ashamed? Why stand ye here astounded, like fawns, which, when they are
wearied, running through the extensive plain, stand, and have no
strength in their hearts? Thus do ye stand amazed, nor fight. Do ye
await the Trojans until they come near, where your fair-prowed galleys
are moored on the shore of the hoary sea, that ye may know whether the
son of Saturn will stretch forth his hand over you.”</p>

   with fighting close-handed, handed, was much despised (cf. Soph.
   Aj. 1120, sqq.; Eur. Herc. Fur. 160), the term ἰόμωροι (οἱ περὶ
   τοὺς ἰοὺς μεμορημένοι, Apoll. Lex. and Hesych.) need not be
   forced into any of the out-of-the-way meanings which Anthon and
   others have assigned to it.</p>
<p>Thus he, acting as commander, kept going through the ranks of heroes,
and he came to the Cretans, going through the throng of men. But they
were armed around warlike Idomeneus. Idomeneus, on his part, [commanded]
in the van, like a boar in strength; but Meriones urged on the hindmost
phalanxes for him. Seeing these, Agamemnon, the king of men, rejoiced,
and instantly accosted Idomeneus, in bland words:</p>
<p>“O Idomeneus, I honour thee, indeed, above the swift-horsed Greeks, as
well in war, as in any other work, and at the banquet, when the nobles
of the Argives mix in their cups the dark-red honourable<span id="footnotetag181"/>

though the other crested Greeks drink by certain measures, thy cup
always stands full, as [mine] to me, that thou mayest drink when thy
mind desires it. But hasten into war, such as formerly thou didst boast
to be.”</p>

<p>But him Idomeneus, the leader of the Cretans, in turn answered: “Son of
Atreus, a very congenial ally will I be to thee, as first I promised and
assented. But exhort the other crested Greeks that we may fight with all
haste, since the Trojans have confounded the league: death and griefs
shall be theirs hereafter, since they first offered injury, contrary to
the league.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke: and the son of Atreus passed on, joyous at heart, and he
came to the Ajaces, going through the troops of the heroes. But they
were armed, and with them followed a cloud of infantry. As when a
goat-herd from a hill-top perceives a cloud traversing the deep, beneath
the north-western blast; and to him, standing at a distance, it appears
while coming over the ocean, darker than pitch, and brings with it a
mighty whirlwind;<span id="footnotetag182"/>

flock into a cave. Such, with the Ajaces, moved into hostile battle the
dense dark phalanxes of Jove-nurtured youths, bristling with shields and
spears. And king Agamemnon seeing them, rejoiced, and accosting them,
spoke winged words:</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote182"/><b>Footnote 182:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-4.htm.html#footnotetag182" class="pginternal">

<p>“Ye Ajaces, leaders of the brazen-mailed Argives, ye two, indeed, for it
becomes me not, I in no respect desire to incite; for ye yourselves
mightily instigate the people to fight valiantly. Would that, O father
Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, such courage were in the breasts of all; soon
then would the city of king Priam bend to its fall, taken and destroyed
by our hands.”</p>
<p>Thus having said, he left them there and went to the others; there he
found Nestor, the harmonious orator of the Pylians, marshalling his
associates, and exhorting them to battle, mighty Pelagon, Alastor,
Chromius, and prince Hæmon, and Bias the shepherd of the people. In
front, indeed, he placed the cavalry<span id="footnotetag183"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-4.htm.html#footnote183" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">183</sup></a> with their horses and
chariots, but the foot, both numerous and brave, in the rear, to be the
stay of the battle; but the cowards he drove into the middle, that
every man, even unwilling, might fight from necessity. At first, indeed,
he gave orders to the horsemen; these he commanded to rein in their
horses, nor to be confused with the crowd. “And let no person, relying
on his skill in horsemanship, and on his strength, desire alone, before
the rest, to fight with the Trojans, nor let him retreat: for [if so],
ye will be weaker. And whatever man, from his own chariot, can reach
that of another, let him stretch out with his spear;<span id="footnotetag184"/>

much better: for thus the ancients overturned cities and walls, keeping

(return) </a> With Arnold and Anthon, I follow Köppen’s
   interpretation. The meaning is, whoever, without leaping from his
   own chariot, can reach that of another, should commence the
   attack. This was less dangerous than dismounting.</p>
<p>Thus the old man, long since well skilled in wars, exhorted them, and
king Agamemnon rejoiced when he saw him; and accosting him, spoke winged
words:</p>
<p>“O old man, would that thy knees could so follow thee, and thy strength
were firm as is the courage in thy breast. But old age, common alike to
all, wearies thee. Would that some other man had thy age, and that thou
wert amongst the more youthful.”</p>
<p>Him then the Gerenian knight Nestor answered: “Son of Atreus, I myself
would much wish to be so, as when I killed Eruthalion. But the gods
never give all things at the same time to men. If I were a young man
then, now in turn old age invades me. Yet even so, I will be with the
horse, and will exhort them with counsel and words: for this is the
office of old men. But let the youths, who are younger than I am, and
confide in their strength, brandish their spears.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; and the son of Atreus passed him by, rejoicing at heart.
Next he found the horseman Menestheus, son of Peteus, standing, and
around him the Athenians skilled in the war-shout: but crafty Ulysses
stood near; and round him stood the ranks of the Cephallenians not
feeble; for not yet had the troops of these heard the shout, since
lately the roused phalanxes of the horse-subduing Trojans and of the
Greeks moved along; but they stood waiting till another division of the
Greeks, coming on, should charge the Trojans and begin the battle.
Having seen these, therefore, Agamemnon, the king of men, reproved them,
and, accosting them, spoke winged words:</p>
<p>“O son of Peteus, Jove-nurtured king, and thou, accomplished in evil
wiles, crafty-minded [Ulysses], why trembling do ye refrain from battle,
and wait for others? It became you, indeed, being amongst the first, to
stand and meet the ardent battle. For ye are the first invited by me to
the feast when we Greeks prepare a banquet for the chiefs. Then it is
pleasant to you to eat the roasted meats, and to quaff cups of sweet
wine, as long as ye please. But now would ye in preference be
spectators, though ten divisions of the Greeks should fight in your
presence with the ruthless brass.”</p>
<p>But him sternly regarding, crafty Ulysses answered thus: “Son of Atreus,
what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth! How canst thou say
that we are remiss in fighting? Whenever we Greeks stir up fierce
conflict against the horse-taming Trojans, thou shalt see, if thou
desirest, and if these things are a care to thee, the beloved father of
Telemachus mingled with the foremost of the horse-taming Trojans. But
thou sayest these things rashly.”</p>
<p>But him king Agamemnon, when he perceived that he was angry, smiling,
addressed, and he retracted his words:</p>
<p>“Noble son of Laertes, much-contriving Ulysses, I neither chide thee in
terms above measure, nor exhort thee. For I am aware that thy mind in
thy breast kens friendly counsels: for thou thinkest the same that I do.
But come, we shall settle these disputes at a future time, should
anything evil have now been uttered. But may the gods render all these
things vain.”</p>
<p>Thus having spoken, he left them there, and went to others; he found
magnanimous Diomede, son of Tydeus, standing by his horses and
brass-mounted<span id="footnotetag185"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-4.htm.html#footnote185" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">185</sup></a> chariot. Near him stood Sthenelus, son of Capaneus.
And having seen him too, king Agamemnon reproved him, and accosting him
thus, spoke winged words:</p>
<p>“Alas! O son of warlike horse-breaking Tydeus, why dost thou tremble?
Why dost thou explore the intervals of the ranks?<span id="footnotetag186"/>

Tydeus thus customary to tremble, but to fight with the enemy far before
his dear companions. So they have said, who beheld him toiling: for I
never met, nor have I beheld him: but they say that he excelled all
others. For certainly with godlike Polynices he entered Mycenæ without
warlike array, a guest, collecting forces: they<span id="footnotetag187"/>

an expedition against the sacred walls of Thebes, and supplicated much
that they would give renowned auxiliaries. But they [the Mycenæans] were
willing to give them, and approved of it, as they urged; but Jove
changed [their design], showing unpropitious omens. But, after they
departed, and proceeded on their way, they came to rushy, grassy Asopus.
Then the Achæans sent Tydeus upon an embassy.<span id="footnotetag188"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-4.htm.html#footnote188" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">188</sup></a> Accordingly he went,
and found many Cadmeans feasting in the palace of brave Eteocles. Then
the knight Tydeus, though being a stranger, feared not, being alone
amongst many Cadmeans: but challenged them to contend [in games], and
easily conquered in all, so mighty a second was Minerva to him. But the
Cadmeans, goaders of steeds, being enraged, leading fifty youths, laid a
crafty ambuscade for him returning: but there were two leaders, Mæon,
son of Hæmon, like unto the immortals, and Lycophontes, persevering in
fight, the son of Autophonus. Tydeus, however, brought cruel death upon
them. He killed them all, but sent one only to return home: for he
dismissed Mæon, obeying the portents of the gods. Such was Ætolian
Tydeus. But he begat a son, inferior to himself in battle, but superior
in council.”</p>

<p>Thus he spoke; but brave Diomede answered nothing, reverencing the
rebuke of the venerable king.</p>
<p>But him the son of renowned Capaneus answered: “Son of Atreus, lie not,
knowing how to tell truth. We, indeed, boast to be far better than our
fathers. We too have taken the citadel of seven-gated Thebes, leading
fewer troops under the wall sacred to Mars, confiding in the portents of

the shepherd of the people, for thus exhorting the well-greaved Greeks
to fight. Glory shall attend him, if, indeed, the Greeks shall conquer

other hand, the Greeks being cut off. But come now, and let us be

dreadfully sounded the brass on the breast of the prince, as he moved
rapidly along: then truly would fear have seized even a brave spirit.</p>

motion; at first indeed it raises itself aloft in the deep, but then
dashed against the land, it roars mightily; and being swollen it rises
high around the projecting points, and spits from it the foam of the
sea: thus then the thick phalanxes of the Greeks moved incessantly on to
battle. Each leader commanded his own troops. The rest went in silence
(nor would you have said that so numerous an army followed, having the
power of speech in their breasts), silently reverencing their leaders.
And around them all their arms of various workmanship shone brightly;
clad with which, they proceeded in order. But the Trojans, as the sheep
of a rich man stand countless in the fold, whilst they are milked of
their white milk, continually bleating, having heard the voice of their
lambs—thus was the clamour of the Trojans excited through the wide
army. For there was not the same shout of all, nor the same voice, but
their language was mixed, for the men were called from many climes.

<p>But they, when now meeting, they had reached the same place, at once
joined their ox-hide shields, and their spears, and the might of
brazen-mailed warriors; and the bossy shields met one another, and much
battle-din arose. There at the same time were heard both the groans and
shouts of men slaying and being slain; and the earth flowed with blood.
As when wintry torrents flowing down from the mountains, mix in a basin
the impetuous water from their great springs in a hollow ravine, and the
shepherd in the mountains hears the distant roar—so arose the shouting
and panic of them, mixed together.</p>
<p>Antilochus first killed a Trojan warrior, Echepolus, son of Thalysias,
valiant in the van. Him he first struck on the cone of his horse-plumed
helmet, and the brazen point fixed itself in his forehead, then pierced
the bone, and darkness veiled his eyes; and he fell, like a tower, in
fierce conflict. Him fallen, king Elephenor, the offspring of Chalcodon,
chief of the magnanimous Abantes, seized by the feet, and was drawing
him beyond the reach of darts in haste, that with all haste he might
despoil him of his armour: but that attempt was short; for magnanimous
Agenor having descried him dragging the body, wounded him with a brazen
spear in the side, which, as he stooped, appeared from beneath the
covert of his shield, and he relaxed his limbs [in death]. His soul
therefore left him. But over him arose a fierce conflict of Trojans and
of Greeks. But they like wolves rushed on each other, and man bore down
man. Then Telamonian Ajax smote the blooming youth Simoïsius, son of
Anthemion, whom formerly his mother, descending from Ida, brought forth
on the banks of Simois, when, to wit, she followed her parents to view
the flocks; wherefore they called him Simoïsius. Nor did he repay to his
dear parents the price of his early nurture, for his life was short, he
being slain with a spear by magnanimous Ajax. For him advancing first,
he [Ajax] struck on the breast, near the right pap: and the brazen
spear passed out through his shoulder on the opposite side. He fell on
the ground in the dust, like a poplar, winch has sprung up in the moist
grass-land of an extensive marsh,—branches grow smooth, yet upon the
very top, which the chariot-maker lops with the shining steel, that he
might bend [it as] a felloe for a beauteous chariot. Drying, it lies
indeed on the banks of the river. So did the high-born Ajax spoil
Simoïsius, the descendant of Anthemion. But at him Antiphus, of the
varied corslet, the son of Priam, took aim through the crowd with a
sharp spear. From whom, indeed, it erred: but he struck Leucus, the
faithful companion of Ulysses, in the groin, as he was drawing the body
aside; but he fell near it, and the body dropped from his hand. For him
slain, Ulysses was much enraged in mind; and he rushed through the van,
armed in shining brass; and advancing very near, he stood, and casting
his eyes all around him, hurled with his glittering spear. But the
Trojans retired in confusion, as the hero hurled; he did not, however,
hurl the spear in vain, but struck Democoon, the spurious son of Priam,
who came from Abydos, from [tending] the swift mares.<span id="footnotetag191"/>

enraged for his companion, struck with his spear in the temple, and the
brazen point penetrated through the other temple, and darkness veiled
his eyes. Falling he made a crash, and his arms resounded upon him. Both
the foremost bands and illustrious Hector fell back. The Argives shouted
aloud, and dragged the bodies away: then they rushed farther forward;
and Apollo was enraged, looking down from Pergamus; and, shouting out,
exhorted the Trojans:</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote191"/><b>Footnote 191:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-4.htm.html#footnotetag191" class="pginternal">

   of the Hellespont.—Scholiast.</p>
<p>“Arouse ye, ye horse-breaking Trojans, nor yield the battle to the
Greeks; since their flesh is not of stone, nor of iron, that when they
are struck, it should withstand the flesh-rending brass; neither does
Achilles, the son of fair-haired Thetis, fight, but at the ships he
nourishes his vexatious spleen.”</p>
<p>Thus spoke the dreadful god from the city. But most glorious Tritonian
Pallas, the daughter of Jove, going through the host, roused the Greeks
wherever she saw them relaxing.</p>
<p>Then fate ensnared Diores, son of Amarynceus; for he was struck with a
jagged hand-stone, at the ankle, on the right leg; but Pirus, son of
Imbrasus, who came from Ænos, the leader of the Thracian warriors,
struck him. The reckless stone entirely crushed both tendons and bones;
supine in the dust he fell, stretching forth both hands to his dear
companions, and breathing forth his soul. But Pirus, he who struck him,
ran up, and pierced him in the navel with his spear; and thereupon all
his entrails poured forth upon the ground, and darkness veiled his eyes.</p>
<p>But him<span id="footnotetag192"/>

breast over the pap, and the brass was fastened in his lungs: Thoas came
near to him, and drew the mighty spear out of his breast; then he
unsheathed his sharp sword, and with it smote him in the midst of the
belly, and took away his life. But he did not spoil him of his armour,
for his companions stood round him, the hair-tufted Thracians, holding
long spears in their hands, who drove him from them, though being
mighty, and valiant, and glorious; but he, retreating, was repulsed with
force. Thus these two were stretched in the dust near to each other;
Pirus, indeed, the leader of the Thracians, and Diores, the leader of
the brazen-mailed Epeans; and many others also were slain around.</p>

stretched prone in the dust beside one another.</p>
