<p>The exploits of Diomedes, who, irritated by a wound from Pandarus,
fights with unremitted fury, and even wounds Venus and Mars, who were
aiding the Trojans.</p>

Then, moreover, Pallas Minerva gave strength and daring to Diomede, the
son of Tydeus, that he might become conspicuous amongst all the Argives,
and might bear off for himself excellent renown. And she kindled from
his helmet and his shield an unwearied fire, like unto the summer<span id="footnotetag194"/>

<p>Now there was amongst the Trojans one Dares, rich, blameless, the priest
of Vulcan; and he had two sons, Phegeus and Idæus, well skilled in all
kinds of battle: these twain, apart [from their companions], rushed to
meet [Diomede]; they on their part, from their two-horse chariot, but
he, from the ground, made the attack on foot. When these, therefore,
advancing against each other, were now near, Phegeus first hurled forth
his long-shadowed spear, and the point of the spear went over the left
shoulder of the son of Tydeus, nor did it strike him. But the son of
Tydeus next rushed on with his brazen javelin; nor did the weapon fly in
vain from his hand, but struck his [Phegeus’s] breast between the paps,
and forced him from his chariot. Then Idæus leaped down, having left the
very beautiful chariot, nor ventured to protect his slain brother. [In
vain,] for not even he would have escaped gloomy fate, but Vulcan
snatched him away, and saved him, having enveloped him in darkness, that
the old man might not be altogether sad. But the son of magnanimous
Tydeus having taken the horses, gave them to his companions to lead to
the hollow ships. When the magnanimous Trojans beheld the sons of Dares,

were discomfited. But azure-eyed Minerva, seizing him by the hand, thus
addressed impetuous Mars: “Mars, Mars, man-slayer, gore-stained, stormer
of walls, should we not suffer the Trojans and the Greeks to fight, to
which side soever father Jove may give glory; but let us retire, and
avoid the wrath of Jove?”</p>
<p>Thus having said, she led impetuous Mars from the battle, and afterwards
seated him on grassy<span id="footnotetag197"/>

to flight, and each of the leaders slew his man. First Agamemnon, king
of men, hurled from his chariot huge Hodius, chief of the Halizonians.
For in the back of him first turned [in flight], between his shoulders
he fixed the spear, and drove it through his breast; and falling, he
made a crash, and his arms resounded upon him.</p>
<p>But next Idomeneus killed Phæstus, the son of Mæonian Borus, who had
come from fertile Tarne. Him, just as he was mounting his chariot,<span id="footnotetag198"/>

shoulder: he fell from his chariot, and hateful darkness seized him.
Then the attendants of Idomeneus despoiled him of his arms.</p>

flying before him, with a spear in the back, between the shoulders, and
drove [the spear] through his breast. Prone he fell, and his arms

<p>Meriones slew Phereclus, son of the artist Harmon, who knew how to form

<p>But Meges next slew Pedæus, son of Antenor, who, indeed, was a spurious
son, yet noble Theano brought him up with care, equally with her own
dear children, gratifying her husband. Him the spear-famed son of
Phyleus, on his part, coming near, smote on the back of the head with
his sharp spear; the steel cut through his teeth under his tongue. In
the dust he fell, and caught the cold steel in his teeth.</p>
<p>But Eurypylus, son of Evæmon, slew noble Hypsenor, son of magnanimous
Dolopion, who was priest of Scamander, and was honoured as a god by the
people; him, as he was flying before him, Eurypylus, then, the
illustrious son of Evæmon, struck in the shoulder in his flight, rushing
on with his sword, and cut off his heavy hand: then the gory hand fell
in the field; but blood-red death and stern fate seized his eyes.</p>
<p>Thus they on their part laboured in the violent fight. But you would not
have known the son of Tydeus, to which side he belonged, whether he was
mixed with the Trojans or with the Greeks. For he rushed through the
plain, like unto a river swollen by mountain-streams, which flowing
rapidly throws down bridges: and this, neither the fortified dams can
restrain, nor the fences of the richly-blooming fields check, as it
comes suddenly, when the rain-storm of Jove bears down heavily: many
hopeful works of vigorous youths are wont to fall by it. Thus by the son
of Tydeus were the close phalanxes of the Trojans thrown into confusion;
nor did they withstand him, although being numerous.</p>
<p>When, therefore, Pandarus, the illustrious son of Lycaon, saw him
rushing through the field, discomfiting the phalanxes before him, he
drew his crooked bow, and smote him rushing on, striking him upon the
right shoulder [on] the cavity of the corslet: the bitter shaft flew on
and broke through to the other side; and the corslet was stained with
blood. Whereupon the illustrious son of Lycaon exclaimed aloud:</p>
<p>“Rush on, ye magnanimous Trojans, spurrers of steeds, for the bravest
of the Greeks is wounded; nor do I think that he will long endure the
violent arrow, if king Apollo, the son of Jove, really urged me
proceeding from Lycia.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, vaunting; but him [Diomede] the swift arrow did not
subdue: but having retreated, he stood before his horses and chariot,
and thus accosted Sthenelus, son of Capaneus:</p>
<p>“Haste, dear son of Capaneus, descend from thy chariot, that thou mayest
draw from my shoulder the bitter shaft.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, and Sthenelus leaped from his chariot to the ground, and,
standing by him, drew the swift, deeply-piercing arrow forth from his
shoulder, and the blood spurted out through the twisted mail. Then
Diomede, brave in battle, prayed:</p>
<p>“Hear me, O daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unwearied, if ever favouring
thou stoodest by me and my sire in the hostile fight, now in turn
befriend me, O Minerva. And grant me to slay this man, and that he may
approach within the aim of my spear, who being beforehand has struck me,
and boasts, and says that I shall not long behold the brilliant light of
the sun.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, praying, and Pallas Minerva heard him, and made light his
limbs, his feet, and his hands above, and standing near him, spoke
winged words:</p>
<p>“With confidence, now, O Diomede, fight against the Trojans; for into
thy soul have I sent that intrepid ancestral might, such as the
shield-brandishing knight Tydeus was wont to possess: and moreover I
have taken away the darkness from thine eyes, which before was upon
them, that thou mayest discern a god and also a man. Wherefore now, if
any divinity come hither, making trial of thee, do thou by no means
fight against any other immortal gods; but if Venus, daughter of Jove,
should come into battle, wound her at all events with the sharp brass.”</p>
<p>Thus on her part having spoken, azure-eyed Minerva departed: but the son
of Tydeus, returning again, was mixed with the van; and ardent as he
before was in spirit to fight against the Trojans, then, indeed, thrice
as much courage possessed him. Like as a lion, whom the shepherd in the
country, by his fleecy sheep, has grazed indeed, while overleaping the
court-yard, but has not killed; he [the shepherd] has merely roused his
ardour; but afterwards he ventures no farther aid, but on the contrary
retires within the fold, while the sheep, deserted, fly in
consternation. These, indeed, are huddled in masses one upon another,
but he [the lion] leaps joyfully from the lofty fold.<span id="footnotetag201"/>

Diomede joyfully mixed with the Trojans.</p>
<p>Then he slew Astynoüs, and Hypenor the shepherd of the people: having
smote the one above the pap with the brazen lance, but the other he
smote with his huge sword on the collar-bone at the shoulder, and
separated the shoulder from the neck and back. These, indeed, he left,
but rushed on Abas and Polyïdus, the sons of Eurydamas, the aged
interpreter of dreams; to whom going to the war, the old man did not
interpret their dreams; but brave Diomede spoiled them when slain. Then
he went against Xanthus and Thoon, the sons of Phænops, both dearly
cherished;<span id="footnotetag202"/>

another son to leave over his possessions. These, then, Diomede slew,
and took their life from both, but to their father left grief and

battle; but his next of kin<span id="footnotetag203"/>

<p>Then he seized Echemon and Chromius, two sons of Dardanian Priam, being
in one chariot. As when a lion, leaping amidst the herd, has broken the
neck of a heifer or of an ox pasturing in a thicket; so did the son of
Tydeus forcibly dislodge them both from the chariot against their wills,
and then spoiled them of their arms. But the steeds he gave to his
companions, to drive to the ships.</p>
<p>But him Æneas beheld devastating the ranks of men, and he hastened to go
both through the battle and the din of spears, seeking godlike Pandarus,
if anywhere he might find him. He found the blameless and valiant son of
Lycaon, and stood before him, and spoke [this] word to him:</p>
<p>“O Pandarus, where are thy bow and thy winged shafts, and thy renown,
with which no man here at least contends with thee, nor does any person
in Lycia boast to be braver than thou? But come, having raised thy hands
to Jove, aim an arrow against this man, (whoever he be, who is thus
prevailing, and who has already wrought many ills against the Trojans,
since he has relaxed the knees of many and of brave), unless he be some
god, wrathful against the Trojans, angry on account of sacrifices [not
offered]: and unless the severe wrath of a deity be upon us.”</p>
<p>Him the illustrious son of Lycaon answered in turn: “Æneas, counsellor
of the brazen-mailed Trojans, I assimilate him in all respects to the
warlike son of Tydeus, recognizing him by his shield and oblong helmet,
and looking on his steeds: but I do not know certainly whether he be a
god. But if this man, whom I speak of, be the warlike son of Tydeus, he
does not perform these frantic deeds without divine aid, but some one of
the immortals stands near, wrapped round as to his shoulders<span id="footnotetag204"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-5.htm.html#footnote204" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">204</sup></a> in a
cloud, who has turned into another course the swift shaft just about to
hit him. For but just now I aimed an arrow at him, and struck him on the
right shoulder, entirely through the cavity of his corslet; and I
thought I should hurl him down to Pluto; yet did I not altogether subdue
him; some god, of a truth, is wrathful. And steeds and chariots are not
present, which I might ascend: but somewhere in the palaces of Lycaon
[are] eleven chariots, beautiful, newly-built, lately made: coverings
are spread around them: and beside each of them stand steeds yoked in
pairs, eating white barley and wheat. Of a truth the aged warrior Lycaon
gave me, on setting out, very many commands in his well-built palaces:
he ordered me, having ascended my steeds and my chariot, to command the
Trojans in the fierce conflicts; but I heeded him not (and truly it
would have been much better), sparing my steeds, lest they, accustomed
to feed largely, should want food, to my cost,<span id="footnotetag205"/> <a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-5.htm.html#footnote205" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">205</sup></a>
the men being shut up [in the city]. Thus I left them; but I have come on foot
to Troy, relying on my bow and arrows, but these were not destined to profit
me. For lately I aimed [a shaft] at two chiefs, at the son of Tydeus and the
son of Atreus; and having struck, I drew blood manifestly from both; but I
roused them the more. Therefore, with evil fate I took down my curved bow from
the peg, on that day when I led the Trojans to pleasant Ilium, doing a favour
to divine Hector. But if I shall return, and shall with these eyes behold my
country, and my wife, and my lofty-roofed great palace, immediately may some
hostile man cut off my head, if I do not put this bow into the shining fire,
having broken it with my hands; for it attends on me to no purpose.”</p>

<p>Him then Æneas, the leader of the Trojans, addressed in turn: “Speak not
so: but it will not be otherwise, before that we twain, with horses and
chariot, going against this man, make trial of him with arms. But come,
ascend my chariot; that thou mayest see of what kind are the steeds of
Tros, skilful in the plain to pursue rapidly here and there, and to
retreat; they also shall bring us safe again to the city, if Jove will a
second time afford glory to Diomede, the son of Tydeus. But come, take
the whip now, and the shining reins, and I will descend from the
chariot, that I may fight; or do thou await this man, and the steeds
shall be my care.”</p>
<p>Him then the illustrious son of Lycaon answered in turn: “Æneas, do thou
thyself hold the reins and thy own steeds: the better will they bear
along the curved chariot under their accustomed charioteer, if we shall
fly back from the son of Tydeus; lest they, taking fright, should become
restive, and be unwilling to bear us away from the war, missing thy
voice, and the son of magnanimous Tydeus, rushing on us, should slay
ourselves, and drive away thy solid-hoofed steeds. But do thou thyself
drive the chariot and thy own steeds, but with my sharp spear will I
receive him advancing.”</p>
<p>Thus having said, ascending the variegated chariot, they directed the
swift steeds impetuously against the son of Tydeus. But Sthenelus, the
illustrious son of Capaneus, perceived them, and immediately to the son
of Tydeus he spoke winged words:</p>
<p>“Diomede, son of Tydeus, most dear to my soul, I perceive two valiant
men eager to fight against thee, possessing immense might; one, indeed,
well-skilled in the bow,<span id="footnotetag206"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-5.htm.html#footnote206" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">206</sup></a> Pandarus, and moreover he boasts to be the
son of Lycaon, and Æneas, [who] boasts to be born the son of magnanimous
Anchises; but Venus is his mother. But come, let us now retire, having
ascended our horses, nor thus, I pray thee, run furiously through the
van, lest thou shouldst lose thy dear life.”</p>
<p>But him sternly regarding, brave Diomede thus addressed: “Talk not to me
of retreat,<span id="footnotetag207"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-5.htm.html#footnote207" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">207</sup></a> since I think thou wilt not persuade me. It becomes not
my nature to fight in a skulking manner, nor to tremble; as yet my
strength is unimpaired. I am averse to mount the chariot, but even as I
am will I advance to meet them: spear-brandishing Minerva does not
suffer me to tremble. Never shall the swift horses bear these twain both
back again from us, supposing even one of them shall escape. But another
thing I tell thee, and do thou lay it up in thy soul, if most prudent
Minerva should grant me the glory to kill both, then do thou detain here
these swift steeds, stretching forth the reins from the rim, and,
mindful, rush upon the horses of Æneas, and drive them from the Trojans
to the well-greaved Greeks. For they are of that breed which far-seeing
Jove gave as a price to Tros for his son Ganymede; wherefore they are
the best of steeds, as many as are under the east and the sun. From this
breed Anchises, king of men, stole them, having supplied mares without
the knowledge of Laomedon: of the breed of these six were foaled in his
courts. Reserving four himself, he nourished them at the manger, and
two, skilled in rousing terror, he gave to Æneas. If we can take these,
we shall have borne away excellent glory.”</p>

Lycaon first accosted Diomede:</p>

<p>He said, and brandishing [it], he sent forth his long-shadowed spear,
and struck the shield of Tydides: but the brazen spear flying straight
through, approached the corslet. Then the son of Lycaon shouted loudly
over him:</p>
<p>“Thou art wounded in the flank, through and through, nor do I think thou
wilt endure it much longer: but to me hast thou given great glory.”</p>
<p>But him the valiant son of Tydeus, undisturbed, addressed: “Thou hast

<p>Thus having spoken, he hurled forth [his lance], and Minerva directed
the weapon to his nose, near the eye; and it passed quite through his
white teeth: and then unwearied, the brass cut the root of his tongue,

swift-footed steeds started aside through fright, and there were his
soul and strength dissolved. Æneas then bounded down with his shield and
long spear, fearing lest the Greeks by any means should take the body
away from him. He walked round it, therefore, like a lion, confiding in
his strength: and before him he stretched out his lance, and his shield
equal on all sides, shouting dreadfully, eager to slay him, whoever
might come against him. But the son of Tydeus seized in his grasp a
hand-stone, a huge affair, such as no two men could carry, such at least
as mortals are now; but he even alone easily wielded it. With it he
struck Æneas on the hip, where the thigh is turned in the hip;—they
call it the socket;—the socket he smote violently, and broke besides
both tendons, and the rugged stone tore off the skin. But the hero
having fallen on his knees, remained so, and supported himself with his
strong hand upon the ground, and dark night veiled his eyes.</p>

battle. Nor was the son of Capaneus forgetful of those commands which
warlike Diomede gave him: but he detained his own solid-hoofed steeds
apart from the tumult, having stretched forth the reins from the rim;
and rushing forward, drove from the Trojans to the well-greaved Greeks
the beautiful-maned steeds of Æneas, and gave them to Deipylus, his

possessed in his mind sentiments congenial with himself), to drive them

having stretched forward, wounded the feeble [goddess] in the extremity
of the hand, bounding on with the sharp brass. Instantly the spear
pierced through the skin, through her ambrosial robe (which the Graces
themselves had wrought), at the extremity [of the hand] above the palm.
Immortal blood flowed from the goddess, ichor, such, to wit, as flows
from the blessed gods. For they eat not bread, nor drink dark wine;
therefore are they bloodless, and are called immortal. But she screaming
aloud, cast her son from her: and him Phoebus Apollo rescued in his
hands in a sable cloud, lest any of the swift-horsed Greeks, casting the
steel into his breast, should take away his life. But warlike Diomede
shouted loudly after her:</p>

<p>“Withdraw, O daughter of Jove, from war and battle. Is it not sufficient
that thou dost practise deception upon feeble women? But if thou wilt go
to the war, I certainly think thou wilt hereafter dread battle, even
though thou but hearest of it elsewhere.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke: but she departed, distracted [with pain], for she was
grievously exhausted. But swift-footed Iris having taken her, led her
outside the crowd, oppressed with griefs; but she began to turn livid as
to her beauteous skin. Then she found impetuous Mars sitting at the left
of the battle; and his spear and swift horses had been enveloped in
darkness. But she, falling on her knees, with many entreaties besought
from her dear brother his golden-frontleted steeds:</p>
<p>“Dear brother, render me a service, and give me thy steeds, that I may
go to Olympus, where is the seat of the immortals. I am grievously
oppressed with a wound which a mortal man, the son of Tydeus, inflicted
on me, who now would fight even with father Jove.”</p>
<p>Thus she spoke: but Mars gave her the golden-frontleted steeds. But she
mounted the chariot, grieving in her heart; and Iris mounted beside her,
and took the reins in her hands, and scourged them to go on, and they
flew not unwillingly. And immediately then they reached the seat of the
gods, the lofty Olympus. There nimble, swift-footed Iris stayed the
steeds, having loosed them from the chariot, and set before them
ambrosial fodder. But the goddess Venus fell at the knees of her mother
Dione; and she embraced her daughter in her arms, and soothed her with
her hand, and addressed her, and said:</p>
<p>“Which of the heavenly gods, beloved daughter, has wantonly done such
things to thee, as if thou hadst openly wrought some evil?”</p>
<p>But her laughter-loving Venus answered: “The son of Tydeus, haughty
Diomede, has wounded me, because I was withdrawing from battle my
beloved son Æneas, who is by far most dear to me of all. For it is no
longer the destructive contest of Trojans and of Greeks; but now the
Greeks fight even with the immortals.”</p>
<p>But her Dione, divine one of goddesses, answered: “Endure, my daughter,
and bear up, although grieved; for many of us, possessing Olympian
habitations, have in times past endured pains at the hand of men,<span id="footnotetag213"/>

imposing heavy griefs on one another. Mars, in the first place, endured
it, when Otus and valiant Ephialtes, the sons of Aloëus, bound him in a
strong chain. He was chained in a brazen prison for thirteen months: and
perhaps Mars, insatiate of war, had perished there, had not his
stepmother, all-fair Eëribæa, told it to Mercury; but he stole Mars
away, already exhausted, for the cruel chain subdued him. Juno also
suffered, when the brave son of Amphitryon smote her in the right
breast with a three-pronged shaft. Then most irremediable pain seized
her. Amongst these Pluto also endured a swift shaft, when the same hero,
the son of ægis-bearing Jove, afflicted him with pains at Pylos amongst
the dead, having wounded him. But he went to the palace of Jove, and the
lofty Olympus, grieving in his heart, and transfixed with pains; for the
shaft had pierced into his huge shoulder, and tortured his soul. But
Pæon healed him, sprinkling pain-assuaging remedies, for he was not at
all mortal. Audacious, regardless one! who felt no compunction in doing
lawless deeds,—who with his bow violated the gods that dwell in
Olympus. But against thee azure-eyed goddess Minerva has excited this
man. Infatuate! nor does the son of Tydeus know this in his mind, that
he is by no means long-lived who fights with the immortals, nor ever at
his knees will sons lisp a father’s name, as he returns from war and
dreadful battle. Therefore, let the son of Tydeus now, though he be very
brave, have a care, lest a better than thou fight with him: lest at a
future time Ægialëa, the very prudent daughter of Adrastus, the noble
spouse of horse-taming Diomede, grieving, should rouse her servants from
sleep, longing for the husband of her youth, the bravest of the Greeks.”</p>

(return) </a> Speaking of these humiliations of the gods, Grote,
   Hist. t. i. p. 78, well observes: “The god who serves is for a
   time degraded; but the supreme god who commands the servitude is
   in the like proportion exalted, whilst the idea of some sort of
   order and government among these super-human beings was never
   lost sight of.”</p>
<p>She spoke, and with her palms wiped off the ichor from her hand: the
hand was healed, and the severe pains mitigated. But then Minerva and
Juno looking on, provoked Saturnian Jove with heart-cutting words; but
amidst them azure-eyed goddess Minerva thus began speaking:</p>
<p>“Father Jove, wilt thou indeed be angry with me on account of what I
shall say? Surely it must be that Venus, inspiring some one of the
Grecian women with a desire of accompanying the Trojans, whom now she
exceedingly loves, while caressing one of those fair-robed Grecian
women, has torn her delicate hand against a golden buckle.”</p>
<p>Thus she spoke: but the father of men and gods smiled, and having
called, he thus accosted golden Venus:</p>
<p>“Not to thee, daughter mine, are intrusted warlike works; but do thou
confine thyself to the desirable offices of marriage, and all these
things shall be a care to swift Mars and to Minerva.”</p>
<p>Thus they, indeed, were speaking such things to each other. But Diomede,
doughty in the din of battle, rushed upon Æneas, conscious that Apollo
himself held over him his hands. But he revered not the mighty god, for
he always longed to slay Æneas, and despoil him of his glorious armour.
Thrice then, immediately, he rushed on, eager to slay him, and thrice
Apollo repelled his shield with violence; but when at length the fourth
time he rushed on, like a god, the far-darting Apollo menacing terribly,
addressed him: “Consider, O son of Tydeus, and retire, nor wish to think
things equal with the gods; for the race of the immortal gods and of men
walking on the earth is in nowise similar.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke: but the son of Tydeus retired a little, biding the wrath
of far-darting Apollo. But Apollo placed Æneas apart from the crowd, in
sacred Pergamus, where his temple was.<span id="footnotetag214"/>

Diana healed him in the mighty shrine, and adorned him with glory. But
silver-bowed Apollo formed a phantom like unto Æneas himself and such in
arms. Around the phantom the Trojans and the noble Greeks smote on each
others’ breasts the well-battered ox-hide shields, and the light
bucklers. Then at length Phœbus Apollo addressed impetuous Mars:</p>

   temple of Apollo, Diana and Latona; and hence Homer represents
   these three deities protecting the falling city.”—Μüller,
   Dorians, vol. i. p. 248.</p>
<p>“Mars! Mars! man-slaughterer, gore-tainted, wall-batterer! wouldst not
thou now, meeting this man, the son of Venus, withdraw him from the
battle, who would even now cope with father Jove? First, indeed, in
close combat, he wounded Venus in the hand, at the wrist; but then he
assailed me, like unto a god.”</p>
<p>Thus having spoken, he sat down on lofty Pergamus; but destructive Mars
aroused the ranks of the Trojans, going through them, assimilating
himself to Acamus, the swift leader of the Thracians, and thus he
harangued the Jove-nourished sons of Priam:</p>
<p>“Ye sons of Priam, Jove-nourished king, how long will ye suffer the
people to be slain by the Greeks? Is it until they fight around the
well-made gates? A hero lies prostate, whom we honoured equally with
noble Hector, the son of magnanimous Anchises. But come, let us rescue
from the assault our excellent companion.”</p>
<p>Thus having spoken, he excited the might and courage of heart. Then
Sarpedon much rebuked noble Hector:</p>
<p>Hector, where now has that strength gone, which thou didst formerly
possess? Thou saidst, I ween, that thou, with thy kindred and thy
brothers, couldst defend the city without the forces and allies. Now I
can neither see nor perceive any of these; but they crouch down, like
dogs but a lion: we, on the contrary, who are here mere allies, bear the
brunt of the fight. Even I, being thine ally, have come from a very
great distance; for far off is Lycia, at lying Xanthus, where I left my
beloved wife and my infant son, and many possessions, which he who is
poor covets: but I, nevertheless, exhort the Lycians, and ready myself
to fight with that hero; and yet there is here to me such store as the
Greeks can carry or let. But thou standest still, and dost not exhort
even the forces to stand and to defend their wives. Beware perchance,
as though ensnared in the meshes of an alluring net, thou become a prey
and a spoil to hostile for quickly will they destroy thy well-inhabited
city. As it behoves thee, both night and day, to interest thyself in
these matters, beseeching the chiefs of thy far-summoned force to
persevere with ardour, and forego their violent strife.</p>
<p>Thus spoke Sarpedon, but his speech gnawed the heart of Hector, and
immediately he leaped from his chariot with his armour to the ground,
and brandishing his sharp spear, went in all directions through the
army, exhorting the battle; and he stirred up a grievous conflict. The
Trojans rallied and stood against the Greeks; but the Greeks stood in
close array, withstood them, nor fled.</p>
<p>And as the wind scatters the chaff about the threshing-floors, when men
are winnowing [it], and yellow Ceres is separating both the grain and
the chaff, the winds rush along; and the chaff-heaps<span id="footnotetag215"/>

beneath; thus then the Greeks became white with the chaff from above,
which indeed through them, as they again mingled in the combat, the feet
of the steeds struck up [the ground] to the brazen heaven; for the
charioteers turning back. But they directed the strength of theirs
straight forward; and fierce Mars spread a vapour over the battle,
aiding the Trojans, going about everywhere, echoing the commands of
golden-sworded Phœbus Apollo and ordered him to excite the courage of
the Trojans, whenever he should see Pallas Minerva departing; for she
was an ally of the Greeks. But he sent forth Æneas from his very rich
shrine and infused strength into the breast of the shepherd of the
people.</p>

They did not ever, ask any questions; for a different labour did not

insatiably raging, had excited. But then Greeks, the two Ajaces, and

blowing with shrill blasts, disperse the shadowy clouds. Thus the Greeks
awaited the Trojans, standing firm, nor fled. But the son of Atreus kept
hurrying through the host, exhorting them much:</p>
<p>“O friends, be men, and assume a valiant heart, and feel shame<span id="footnotetag218"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-5.htm.html#footnote218" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">218</sup></a>
towards each other through the fierce engagements: for more of those men
who dread shame are safe, than are slain; but from fugitives neither
does any glory arise, nor any assistance.”</p>
<p>He spoke, and darted with his spear quickly, and struck Dëicoon, son of
Pergasis, a warrior chief, the companion of magnanimous Æneas, whom the
Trojans honoured equally with the sons of Priam; since he was prompt to
fight amidst the van. Him then king Agamemnon struck in the shield with
his spear, but it [the shield] did not repel the spear, for even through
this it passed onwards, and pierced him through the belt, at the lower
part of the stomach. And he made a crash as he fell, and his arms
rattled over him.</p>
<p>Here then Æneas slew some brave heroes of the Greeks,—Crethon and
Orsilochus, the sons of Diocles: their father, indeed, rich in
sustinence,<span id="footnotetag219"/> <a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-5.htm.html#footnote219" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">219</sup></a>

flows widely through the land of the Pylians. Alpheus begat Orsilochus, a

were born two sons, Crethon and Orsilochus, well skilled in all kinds of
battle. These, indeed, in the bloom of youth, in their sable ships followed
with the Argives to Ilium famed for noble steeds, seeking honour for the sons
of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus: but there the end of death overshadowed
them.</p>

<p>Then they slew Pylæmenes, equal to Mars, general of the magnanimous
shielded Paphlagonians. Him indeed the son of Atreus, spear-renowned
Menelaus, wounded with a spear as he stood, having smote him on the
collar-bone. But Antilochus on his part smote the charioteer Mydon, his
brave attendant, the son of Atymnias (now he was in the act of turning
his solid-hoofed steeds), having struck him with a hand-stone on the
elbow; immediately the reins, white with ivory, fell from his hands on
the ground in the dust. But Antilochus, rushing on, smote him with his
sword in the temple, and panting he fell from the well-made chariot,
headlong in the dust, on his head and his shoulders. Very long he stood
(for he fell on deep sand), till the two horses, striking him, cast him
to the ground in the dust: but Antilochus lashed them on, and drove them
to the army of the Greeks.</p>
<p>But them Hector discerned through the ranks, and rushed on them,
vociferating, and with him followed the brave phalanxes of the Trojans.
Mars and venerable Bellona led them; she, on the one hand, bearing with
her tumultuous Din, but Mars, on the other, brandished a huge spear in
his hands. At one time, indeed, he paced before Hector, at another after
him.</p>
<p>But him Diomede, brave in fight, seeing, trembled. As when a man,
uncertain of his course, passing over a great plain, has stopped at a
swift-flowing river, running into the sea, beholding it boiling with
foam, and retreats back in haste: so then did the son of Tydeus retire,
and he said to the host:</p>
<p>“O friends, how do we all admire noble Hector, that he is both a
spearman and a daring warrior! But with him one at least of the gods is
ever present, who wards off death; even now Mars in person stands by him
like unto a mortal man. But retreat back, [with your faces] turned
always to the Trojans, nor desire to fight valiantly against the gods.”</p>
<p>Thus then he said: but the Trojans advanced very near them. There Hector
slew two heroes skilled in battle, Menesthes and Anchialus, being in one
chariot. But mighty Telamonian Ajax pitied them falling; and advancing
he stood very near them, and launched with his shining spear, and smote
Amphius, son of Selagus, who, exceedingly rich in property and crops,
dwelt in Pæsus. But fate had led him as an ally to Priam and his sons.
Him Telamonian Ajax smote on the belt, and the long-shadowed spear was
fixed in the pit of his stomach. Falling, he made a crash, and
illustrious Ajax ran up to him, about to spoil [him of] his armour; but
the Trojans poured upon him sharp spears, shining all around, and his
shield received many. But he, pressing on him with his heel, drew from
the body his brazen spear; however, he was not able to take off from his

<p>Thus they, on the one hand, toiled through the violent conflict. But
violent fate urged on Tlepolemus, the brave and great son of Hercules,
against godlike Sarpedon. But when they, the son and grandson of
cloud-collecting Jove, were now rushing against one another, Tlepolemus
first addressed him [Sarpedon]:</p>
<p>“Sarpedon, chief of the Lycians, what necessity is there for thee, being
a man unskilled in war, to tremble here? Falsely do they say that thou
art the offspring of ægis-bearing Jove, since thou art far inferior to
those heroes, who were of Jove, in the time of ancient men. But what
sort do they say that Hercules was, my bold-minded, lion-hearted father?
who formerly coming hither, on account of the steeds of Laomedon, with
six ships only, and with a few men, laid waste the city of Ilium, and
widowed its streets. But thou hast an ignoble mind, and thy forces are
perishing away; nor do I think that thou wilt be an assistance to the
Trojans, having come from Lycia, not even if thou be exceedingly
valiant; but that, slain by me, thou wilt pass through the gates of
Hades.”</p>
<p>But him Sarpedon, leader of the Lycians, in return accosted:
“Tlepolemus, he indeed overturned sacred Ilium, through the folly of the
hero, famous Laomedon, who reproved with harsh language him who had
deserved well, nor did he give back the steeds, on account of which he
came from afar. But I tell thee that here slaughter and gloomy death
will befall thee at my hands; and that, subdued by my spear, thou wilt
give glory to me, and a spirit to steed-famed<span id="footnotetag224"/>

   (“inferni raptoris equos,” Claudian, de R. P. i. 1) employed in
   the abduction of Proserpine.</p>
<p>Thus spoke Sarpedon: but Tlepolemus raised his ashen spear, and from
their hands, at the same moment, flew the long spears. Sarpedon, on his
part, struck the centre of [his adversary’s] neck, and the grievous
weapon passed right through; and gloomy night overspread his eyes. But
Tlepolemus in the meantime had struck Sarpedon in the left thigh with
his long spear; and the spear, rushing with violence, passed through,
grazing the bone: but his father as yet averted death.</p>
<p>His noble companions bore godlike Sarpedon from the battle; but the long
spear, trailed along with him, pained him; but this no one of them
hastening noticed, nor thought of extracting from his thigh the ashen
spear, that he might ascend the chariot; for such anxiety did his
attendants entertain for him. But on the other side the well-greaved
Greeks carried Tlepolemus from the fight; and divine Ulysses, possessing
an enduring heart, perceived them, and his soul was stirred within him.
And then he anxiously pondered in his mind and soul, whether he should
pursue farther the son of loud-thundering Jove, or should take away the
lives of many more Lycians. But it was not fated for magnanimous Ulysses
to slay the brave son of Jove with the sharp spear. Therefore Minerva
turned his thoughts towards the multitude of the Lycians. Then he slew
Cœranus, and Alastor, and Chromius, and Alcander, and Halius, and
Noëmon, and Prytanis. And yet more Lycians would noble Ulysses have
slain, had not mighty crest-tossing Hector quickly perceived him. He
therefore went through the van, armed in shining brass, bearing terror
to the Greeks: then Sarpedon, the son of Jove, rejoiced at him
approaching, and spoke [this] mournful address:</p>
<p>“O son of Priam, I pray thee, suffer me not to lie a prey to the Greeks,
but aid me. Even then<span id="footnotetag225"/>

   I will die content in Troy.—Anthon.</p>
<p>Thus he spoke: but him plume-waving Hector answered nought, but flew
past him, in order that he might repel the Greeks with all haste, and
take away the lives of many. His noble companions meantime placed
godlike Sarpedon under a very beautiful beech of ægis-bearing Jove.
Stout Pelagon then, who was his beloved companion, forced out the ashen
spear from his thigh. Thereupon animation left him, and darkness was
poured over his eyes; but he again revived, for the breeze of Boreas,
breathing upon him around, refreshed in spirit him panting with
difficulty.</p>
<p>But the Greeks, on account of Mars and brazen-helmed Hector, neither
were driven at any time back to their sable ships, nor did they advance
forward to battle; but always kept giving ground, since they had heard
that Mars was with the Trojans.</p>
<p>Then whom first, whom last did Hector, the son of Priam, and brazen Mars
slay? The godlike Teuthras, and moreover the knight Orestes, the Ætolian
spearman Trechus, and Œnomaus, and Helenus of the race of Œnops, and

<p>When therefore the white-armed goddess Juno perceived these Greeks
perishing in the violent engagement, straightway to Minerva she
addressed winged words:</p>
<p>“Strange! O daughter of ægis-bearing Jove, unwearied one, certainly we
have made a vain promise to Menelaus, that he should return after having
destroyed well-walled Ilium, if we suffer destructive Mars thus to rage.
But come, let us too bethink ourselves of some powerful aid.”</p>
<p>Thus she spoke; nor did the azure-eyed goddess Minerva disobey her.
Juno, on her part, venerable goddess, daughter of mighty Saturn, quickly
moving, harnessed her gold-caparisoned steeds; but Hebe speedily applied
to the chariot, to the iron axletree on both sides, the curved wheels,
golden, with eight spokes. Of these, indeed, the felloe is of gold,
imperishable: but above [are] brazen tires fastened on them, wonderful
to be seen; but the circular naves on both sides are of silver; and the

double circular rim); from this projected a silver pole; at its
extremity she bound the golden, beauteous yoke, and to it attached the
beautiful golden poitrels. But Juno, longing for conquest and battle,
led the swift-footed steeds under the yoke.</p>

herself had wrought and worked with her own hands: then she, having put

sufficient for the heavy-armed of a hundred cities. She then stepped
into her shining chariot with her feet; and took her spear, heavy, huge,
and sturdy, with which she, sprung from a dread sire, subdues the ranks
of heroic men, with whomsoever she is wroth. But Juno with the lash
quickly urged on the steeds. The gates of heaven creaked spontaneously,
the gates which the Hours guarded, to whom are intrusted the mighty
heaven and Olympus, as well to open the dense cloud as to close it. In
this way, indeed, through these gates, they drove their steeds, urged on
with the goad: and they found the son of Saturn sitting apart from the
other gods on the highest summit of many-peaked Olympus. There staying
her steeds, the white-armed goddess Juno interrogated supreme Saturnian
Jove, and thus addressed him:</p>
<p>“O father Jove, art thou not indignant at Mars for these bold
deeds,—how numerous and how choice a multitude of Greeks he has
destroyed rashly, nor as became him: a grief indeed to me; but Venus and
silver-bowed Apollo in quiet are delighted, having let slip this frantic
[god], who knows no rights. Father Jove, wilt thou be angry with me if I
drive Mars from the battle, having dreadfully wounded him?”</p>

<p>“Come, incite the pillaging Minerva against him, who is very wont to
cause him to approach grievous woes.”</p>

lashed on her steeds. They flew, not unwillingly, midway between the
earth and the starry heaven. Now, as much haze<span id="footnotetag230"/>

his eyes, sitting upon some lofty point, and looking over the darkling
ocean, so far do the high-sounding steeds of the gods clear at one
bound. But when they now reached Troy, and the two flowing rivers, where
Simois and Scamander unite their streams, there the white-armed goddess
Juno stayed her steeds, having loosed them from the chariot, and shed a
dense mist around them. But to them Simois afforded ambrosial food to
feed on.</p>

horse-breaking Diomede, like raw-devouring lions or wild boars, whose
strength is not feeble, there standing, the white-armed goddess Juno
shouted aloud, having likened herself to great-hearted, brazen-voiced
Stentor, who was accustomed to shout as loud as fifty other men:</p>

<p>“Shame! ye Greeks! foul subjects of disgrace! admirable in form [alone].
As long, indeed, as divine Achilles was wont to be engaged in the war,
the Trojans were not in the habit of advancing beyond the Dardan gates;
for they dreaded his mighty spear; but now they fight at the hollow
ships, far away from the city.”</p>
<p>Thus saying, she aroused the strength and courage of each. The
azure-eyed goddess Minerva rushed towards the son of Tydeus; but she
found that prince by his steeds and chariot, cooling the wound which
Pandarus had inflicted on him with a shaft. For perspiration had
afflicted him beneath the broad belt of his well-orbed shield: with this
was he afflicted, and he was fatigued as to his hand; and raising the
belt, he wiped away the black gore. Then the goddess touched the yoke of
the horses, and said:</p>
<p>“Little like himself has Tydeus begotten a son. Tydeus was certainly
small in body, but a warrior. And even when I suffered him not to fight,
nor to rush furiously to battle, when he came far from the Greeks, an
ambassador to Thebes to the numerous Cadmeans, I commanded him to feast
quietly in the palaces; but he, retaining his doughty spirit, as before,
challenged the youths, the Cadmeans, and easily conquered them in
everything; so great an auxiliary was I to him. But thee, indeed, I
stand by and preserve, and I exhort thee freely to fight against the
Trojans. But either weariness, from great toil, has entered thy limbs,
or at least disheartening fear in some manner possesses thee. Thou art
not henceforth to be deemed at least the son of Tydeus, the gallant son
of Æneus.”</p>
<p>But her valiant Diomede answering addressed: “I know thee, O goddess,
daughter of ægis-bearing Jove; therefore will I willingly tell this word
to thee, nor will I conceal it. Neither does any disheartening fear
possess me, nor any sloth: but as yet I am mindful of thy mandates,
which thou didst enjoin. Thou didst not suffer me to fight with the
other happy gods; but if Venus, the daughter of Jove, should come into
the battle, to wound her at least with the sharp steel. Wherefore now I
myself retire, and have ordered all the other Greeks to be collected
here: for I perceive Mars dispensing the battle.”</p>
<p>But him the azure-eyed goddess Minerva then answered: “Diomede, son of
Tydeus, most dear to my soul, neither fear this Mars at all, nor any
other of the immortals; such an auxiliary am I to thee. But come, first
direct thy solid-hoofed steeds against Mars, strike him in close combat,
nor regard impetuous Mars, this frenzied and unnatural pest, shifter
from one to another; who lately haranguing promised me and Juno, that he
would fight against the Trojans, and aid the Greeks; but now he mixes
with the Trojans, and has forgotten these.”</p>
<p>Thus having said, she forced Sthenelus from his horses to the ground,
dragging him back with her hand; but he promptly leaped down. Then the
goddess herself, infuriate, ascended the chariot beside noble Diomede,
and greatly did the beechen axle groan under the weight; for it bore a
dreadful goddess and a very brave hero. Then Pallas Minerva seized the
scourge and the reins. Straightway she drove the solid-hoofed steeds
against Mars first. He, indeed, had just slain huge Periphas, the
illustrious son of Ochesius, by far the bravest of the Ætolians. Him
indeed gore-stained Mars slew; but Minerva put on the helmet of Pluto
that impetuous Mars might not see her.</p>
<p>But when man-slaughtering Mars saw noble Diomede, he suffered huge
Periphas to lie there, where first slaying him he had taken away his
life, but he went straight against horse breaking Diomede. And when
these came near, advancing against each other, Mars first, over the yoke
and the reins of the steeds, stretched himself forward with his brazen
spear, eager to take away his life. It then the azure-eyed goddess
Minerva having caught in her hand, turned from the chariot, so as to be
borne away in vain. But next Diomede, valiant in the din of war, made
the attack with his brazen spear; and Pallas Minerva firmly fastened it
in his lowest flank, where he was girt with his belt. In that very part
striking, she wounded him, and tore his beautiful skin, and drew out the
spear again. Then roared brazen Mars, as loud as nine or ten thousand
men roar in war, joining the strife of battle. And then fear seized the
terrified Greeks and Trojans, so loud bellowed Mars, insatiate of war.</p>
<p>And as when from the clouds, a gloomy haze appears, a heavy-blowing wind
arising from heat; such did brazen Mars appear to Diomede, son of
Tydeus, going amid the clouds into the broad heaven. Quickly he reached
lofty Olympus, the seat of the gods, and sat near Saturnian Jove,
grieving in his heart, and showed the immortal blood flowing down from
the wound, and complaining, he spoke winged words:</p>
<p>“Father Jove, art thou not incensed beholding these violent deeds? Ever,
of a truth, are we deities suffering most grievous woes from the
machinations of each other, and [whilst] conferring favour upon men. We
all are indignant with thee;<span id="footnotetag232"/>

pernicious daughter, to whom evil works are ever a care. For all the
other gods, as many as are in Olympus, obey thee, and unto thee each of
us is subject. But her thou restrainest not by words, nor by any act,
but dost indulge her, since thou thyself didst beget this destructive
daughter. Who now has urged on Diomede, the overbearing son of Tydeus,
to rage against the immortal gods. Venus he first wounded, in close
fight, in the hand at the wrist; and, equal to a god, he afterwards
rushed on myself; but my swift feet withdrew me; [otherwise] I should
certainly for a long time have endured woes there amidst the dreadful
heaps of slain, or living should have been exhausted by the strokes of
the brass.”</p>

<p>Him sternly regarding, cloud-compelling Jove addressed: “Complain not to
me, inconstant one, sitting by me: for thou art most hateful to me, of
all the gods that possess Olympus: for to thee discord is ever grateful,
and wars and battles: thou hast thy mother Juno’s insufferable and

longer can I endure thy suffering pain, for thou art my offspring, and
to me thy mother brought thee forth. But hadst thou, destructive as thou
art, been born of any other of the gods, even long since hadst thou been
far lower than the sons of Uranus.”</p>

means mortal. As when fig-tree juice,<span id="footnotetag233"/>

deeds of slaughter.</p>
