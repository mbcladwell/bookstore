<h2>BOOK THE SEVENTH.</h2>
<h4 id="pgepubid00020">ARGUMENT.</h4>
<p>Hector challenges the bravest of the Greeks to single combat, and nine
of the chiefs having cast lots, Ajax is appointed to meet him. Having
protracted the contest till night, the combatants exchange gifts, and
separate. A truce is then made for the purpose of burying the dead, and
the Greeks fortify their camp.</p>
<p class="p2">
Thus having said, illustrious Hector rushed forth from the gates, and
with him went his brother Alexander, for both were eager in soul to wage
war and to fight. As when the deity hath given a prosperous wind to
expecting mariners, after they have become weary, agitating the deep
with well-polished oars, and their limbs are relaxed with toil; thus
then did those two appear to the expecting Trojans. Then they slew, the
one,<span id="footnotetag253"/>

whom the club-bearer Areithoüs and large-eyed Philomedusa brought forth;

Iphinous, son of Dexias, upon the shoulder with his spear, as he vaulted
on his swift mares.</p>

   the rim of the helmet. Paschal, de Coronis, i. 2: “Eam galeæ

<p>But he fell from his mares on the ground, and his limbs were relaxed.</p>
<p>But when the azure-eyed goddess Minerva saw them destroying the Greeks,
in fierce engagement, she descended straightway, rushing down from the
tops of Olympus to sacred Ilium. Then Apollo hastened to meet her,
having perceived her from Pergamus, for he wished victory to the
Trojans. And they met each other at the beech-tree. Her first king
Apollo, the son of Jove, addressed:</p>
<p>“Why again dost thou, O daughter of mighty Jove, come ardently from
Olympus, and why has thy mighty soul impelled thee? It is that thou
mightst give to the Greeks the doubtful victory of battle, for thou dost
not pity the Trojans perishing. But if thou obeyest me in aught, which
indeed would be much better, let us now make the war and conflict to
cease this day, afterwards shall they fight until they find an end of
Ilium; since it is pleasing to the mind of you goddesses to overthrow
this city.” <span id="footnotetag255"/>

<p class="i8">    “Ιλιον, ἣν ἐπόλισσε   οσειδάων καἰ Απόλλων,</p>
<p class="i8">    Ιλιον, ἣν ἀλάπαζαν Ἀθηναίη τε καἰ Ἣρη”.</p>
</div></div>
<p>   See Grote’s Hist, of Greece, vol. i. p. 68.</p>
<p>But him in turn the azure-eyed goddess Minerva thus addressed: “Be it
so, Far-darter; for I myself, meditating the same things, came down from
Olympus to the Trojans and the Greeks. But come, how dost thou intend to
make the battle of men to cease?”</p>
<p>Her then in turn king Apollo, the son of Jove, addressed: “Let us arouse
the valiant spirit of horse-breaking Hector, if perchance he will
challenge some one of the Greeks to fight against him singly opposed in
grievous combat. And the well-greaved Greeks enraged will urge on some
single man to fight with noble Hector.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, nor did the azure-eyed goddess disobey. But Helenus, the
dear son of Priam, perceived in his mind the counsel, which seemed good
to the gods deliberating. He therefore went and stood near Hector, and
thus accosted him:</p>
<p>“Hector, son of Priam, equal to Jove in wisdom, wilt thou obey me in
aught? for I am thy brother. Cause all the rest of the Trojans and the
Greeks to sit down, but do thou thyself challenge whoever is the bravest
of the Greeks to fight against thee in grievous combat. For it is not
yet thy fate to die, and draw on fate; for to this effect have I heard
the voice of the immortal gods.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke. But Hector in turn rejoiced exceedingly, having heard his
advice, and accordingly advancing into the midst, grasping his spear in
the middle, he restrained the phalanxes of the Trojans; and they all sat
down. Agamemnon also caused the well-greaved Greeks to sit down; and
Minerva also, and silver-bowed Apollo, sat like unto vulture birds, on a
lofty beech-tree of their sire, the ægis-bearing Jove, delighted with
the heroes; of these the ranks sat thick, horribly bristling with
shields, and helmets, and spears. And as the ripple of the west wind,
just risen, is poured over the ocean, and the sea begins to darken under
it, such sat the ranks of the Greeks and Trojans in the plain: but
Hector thus spoke in the midst of both armies:</p>
<p>“Hear me, ye Trojans, and ye well-greaved Greeks, whilst I speak what
the mind in my breast commands me. Saturnian Jove, indeed, sitting
aloft, has not ratified the leagues, but devising evils against both
sides, ordains them, till either ye take well-turreted Troy, or
yourselves fall at your sea-traversing ships. Amongst you, indeed, there
are the bravest of all the Greeks, of whom whomsoever his mind orders to
fight with me, let him come hither from amongst all, to be a champion
against noble Hector. This then do I propose, but let Jove be our
witness; if, on the one hand, he shall slay me with his long-pointed
spear, having stripped off my armour, let him bear it to the hollow
ships, but send my body home, that the Trojans and the wives of the
Trojans may make me, deceased, a partaker of the funeral pyre. But if,
on the other hand, I shall slay him, and Apollo shall give me glory,
having stripped off his armour, I will bear it to sacred Ilium, and I
will hang it up on the temple of far-darting Apollo: but his body I will
send back to the well-benched ships, that the long-haired Greeks may
perform his exsequies, and pile up for him a tomb on the wide
Hellespont. And hereafter will some one of future men say, as he sails
over the sea in his many-benched ship: ‘This, indeed, is the tomb of a
hero long since deceased, whom once, bearing himself doughtily,
illustrious Hector slew.’ Thus hereafter will some one say; but this my
glory shall never perish.”</p>
<p>Thus he said, but all became mute in silence. Ashamed indeed they were
to refuse, and yet they dreaded to accept [the challenge]. At length,
however, Menelaus stood up, and spoke amongst them, rebuking them with
reproaches, and he groaned greatly in spirit:</p>
<p>“Alas! ye boasters! Greek dames! no longer Grecian men! certainly will
these things be a disgrace, most grievously grievous, if none of the
Greeks will now go against Hector. But may ye all become water and
earth, sitting there each of you, faint-hearted; utterly inglorious: but
I myself will be armed against him. But the issues of victory are rested
in the immortal gods.”</p>
<p>Thus having spoken, he put on his beautiful arms. Then, indeed, Ο
Menelaus, would the end of life have befallen thee at the hands of
Hector, since he was much the better man, had not the princes of the
Greeks, starting up suddenly, restrained thee, and the son of Atreus
himself, wide-ruling Agamemnon, seized thee by the right hand, and
addressed thee, and spoke:</p>
<p>“Thou art mad, O Menelaus! offspring of Jove, nor hast thou any need of
such madness: restrain thyself, although grieved, nor wish for the sake
of contention to fight with a braver man than thyself, Hector, the son
of Priam, whom others also dread. Nay, even Achilles, who is much braver
than thou, dreads to meet him<span id="footnotetag256"/>

to the troop of thy companions, sit down. Against him the Greeks will
set up some other champion. Although he be intrepid and insatiable of
battle, I think that he will gladly bend his knee,<span id="footnotetag257"/>

<p>Thus speaking, the hero dissuaded his brother’s mind, advising him
rightly; and he obeyed. His joyful attendants then stripped the armour
from his shoulders. Then Nestor arose amidst the Greeks, and said:</p>
<p>“O gods, surely great grief comes upon the Grecian land. Certainly the
aged knight Peleus, the excellent counsellor and adviser of the
Myrmidons, will greatly lament, who formerly interrogated me, greatly
rejoiced in his palace, inquiring the race and offspring of all the
Greeks. If he now heard of them all crouching down under Hector, often
indeed would he uplift his hands to the immortals, [praying] that his
soul, [separated] from his limbs, might depart into the house of Pluto.
For would, Ο father Jove, and Minerva, and Apollo, I were young, as when
the assembled Pylians and the spear-skilled Arcadians fought by the
rapid Celadon, at the walls of Phæa, about the streams of Jardan. With
them Ereuthalion, god-like hero, stood in the van, bearing on his
shoulders the armour of king Areïthous, of noble Areïthous, whom men and
beauteous-girt women called by surname Corynetes, since he fought not
with a bow, nor with a long spear, but used to break the phalanxes with
an iron club. Him Lycurgus slew by stratagem, not by strength, in a
narrow defile, where his iron club did not ward off destruction from
him; for Lycurgus, anticipating, pierced him right through the waist
with his spear, and he was dashed to the ground on his back; and he
spoiled him of the armour which brazen Mars had given him, and he indeed
afterwards bore them himself in the battle of Mars. But when Lycurgus
had grown old in his palaces, he gave them to his beloved attendant
Ereuthalion, to be borne: and he, having his armour, challenged all the
bravest: but these trembled and feared very much: nor did any one dare
[to withstand him]. But my bold mind, by its confidence, urged me on to
fight him: now I was the youngest of them all; and I fought with him,
and Minerva gave me glory. And I slew this most mighty and valiant hero,
for vast he lay stretched out on this side and on that. Would that [now]
I were thus young, and my strength entire—so quickly should
crest-tossing Hector meet with a contest. But those of you who are the
bravest of all the Greeks, not even you promptly desire to go against
Hector.”</p>
<p>Thus did the old man upbraid them; and nine heroes in all arose. Much
the first arose Agamemnon, the king of men; after him arose brave
Diomede, son of Tydeus, and after them the Ajaces, clad in impetuous
valour: after them Idomeneus, and Meriones, the armour-bearer of
Idomeneus, equal to man-slaughtering Mars. After them Eurypylus, the
gallant son of Evæmon. And there [also arose] Thoas, son of Andræmon,
and divine Ulysses. All these wished to fight with noble Hector. But
these again the Gerenian knight Nestor addressed:</p>
<p>“Decide now, exclusively by lot, who shall obtain [the accepting of the
challenge]; for he indeed will aid the well-greaved Greeks; and he will
also delight his own soul, if he shall escape safe from the hostile war
and the grievous fight.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, and they marked each his own lot, and they cast them into
the helmet of Agamemnon, the son of Atreus. The people supplicated, and
raised their hands to the gods, and thus would one of them say, looking
towards the wide heaven:</p>
<p>“Ο father Jove, grant that Ajax obtain the lot, or the son of Tydeus, or
the king himself of rich Mycenæ.”</p>
<p>Thus they spake, and the Gerenian knight Nestor shook [the lots], and
the lot of Ajax, which indeed they wished for, leaped forth from the
helmet. Then a herald bearing it around through the multitude, beginning
at the right, showed it to all the chiefs of the Greeks. But they, not
recognizing it, disclaimed it severally. But, when at last the herald,
carrying it round through the multitude, came to him, illustrious Ajax,
who had inscribed and cast it into the helmet, he [Ajax] stretched forth
his hand, and the herald standing near, placed it in it. Having
inspected it, he knew his own mark, and rejoiced in his soul. He cast it
on the ground at his feet, and said:</p>
<p>“Ο friends, surely the lot is mine, and I myself rejoice in my soul,
since I think that I shall conquer noble Hector. But come, while I put
on my warlike arms, do ye meantime pray to Jove, the Saturnian king,
silently within yourselves, that the Trojans may not hear; or even
openly, since we fear no one at all. For no one willingly shall, by
force, overcome me against my will, nor through my inexperience; since I
hope I have not been so ignorantly<span id="footnotetag258"/>

<p>Thus he spoke: but they prayed to Jove, the Saturnian king; and thus
would one of them say looking towards the wide heaven:</p>
<p>“O father Jove, ruling from Ida, most glorious, most mighty, grant to
Ajax to bear away victory, and illustrious glory. But if thou lovest
Hector also, and carest for him, grant equal might and glory to both.”</p>
<p>Thus they spake, and Ajax was arming himself in splendid brass. But when
he had put on all his armour around his body, then he rushed forward: as
moves mighty Mars, who goes to war amidst men, whom the son of Saturn
has engaged to fight with the strength of soul-gnawing strife, such
mighty Ajax advanced, the bulwark of the Greeks, smiling with grim
countenance; but he advanced, taking long strides with his feet beneath,
brandishing his long-shadowed spear. The Greeks, on their part, rejoiced
much on beholding him, but dire dismay seized the Trojans, each one as
to his limbs, and the soul panted in the breast of Hector himself. But
now he could not in anywise retract through fear, nor retire back into
the crowd of the people, since he had challenged to the fight. But Ajax
drew near, bearing a shield, like a tower, brazen, covered with seven
ox-hides, which for him the artist Tychius labouring had wrought,
dwelling at his home in Hyla, by far the most excellent of
leather-cutters, who for him had made a moveable shield, of seven hides
of very fat bulls, and drawn over it an eighth [layer] of brass.
Carrying this before his breast, Telamonian Ajax stood very near Hector,
and menacing addressed him:</p>
<p>“Ο Hector, now thou, alone with me alone, shalt plainly know, what kind
of chiefs are present with the Greeks, even besides Achilles, the
breaker of ranks, the lion-hearted. But he, indeed, abides at his
high-beaked sea-traversing ships, enraged against Agamemnon, the
shepherd of the people. Yet we are such, even many of us, who can go
against thee; but begin the battle and the strife.”</p>
<p>Him then in turn the mighty crest-tossing Hector addressed: “Thou
Jove-sprung Ajax, son of Telamon, ruler of forces, tamper not with me as
with a weak boy, or a woman, who knows not warlike deeds. But I well
know both battles and man-slaughterings. I know how to shift my dry
shield to the right and to the left; wherefore to me it belongs to fight
unwearied. I am also skilled to rush to the battle of swift steeds. I
know too, how, in hostile array, to move skilfully in honour of glowing
Mars. But I do not desire to wound thee, being such, watching
stealthily, but openly, if haply I may strike thee.”</p>
<p>He spoke, and brandishing hurled forth his long-shadowed spear, and
smote the mighty seven-hided shield of Ajax on the outside brass, which
was the eighth [layer] thereon. And the unwearied brass cutting through,
penetrated six folds, and was stuck fast in the seventh hide. Next,
Jove-sprung Ajax in turn sent forth his very long spear, and struck the
all-equal shield of Priam’s son. Through the shining shield passed the
impetuous spear, and was fastened in his very ingeniously-wrought
corslet, and from the opposite side the spear cut his tunic near the
flank. But he inclined himself, and avoided black death. Then they both,
having drawn out their long spears with their hands, joined battle, like
unto raw-devouring lions, or wild boars, whose strength is not feeble.
Then indeed the son of Priam struck the midst of his [Ajax’s] shield
with his spear; it broke not through the brass, but the point of it was
bent. But Ajax, bounding forward, pierced his shield: and the spear went
right through, and repelled him as he rushed on: it glanced over his
neck, cutting it, and black gore gushed forth. But not even thus did
crest-tossing Hector cease from the battle: but retiring back, he seized
in his hand, a black, rough, huge stone, lying in the plain. With it he
struck the mighty seven-hided shield of Ajax, in the midst of the boss,
and the brass rang around. Ajax next taking up a much larger stone,
whirling, discharged it, and applied immense strength. And he broke
through the shield, having struck with a rock like unto a millstone, and
he wounded him in the knee; and he was stretched supine, having come
into violent contact with his shield; but Apollo quickly raised him. And
now in close combat hand to hand, they would have wounded each other
with their swords, had not the heralds, the messengers of gods and men,
arrived, one of the Trojans, the other of the brazen-mailed Greeks,
Talthybius and Idæus, both prudent men. And between both armies they
held their sceptres, but the herald Idæus, skilled in prudent counsels,
said:</p>
<p>“No longer, my dear sons, war or fight, for cloud-collecting Jove loves
you both: ye both are warriors, and this we all know. Night is now
approaching, and it is good to obey night.” <span id="footnotetag259"/>

<p>But him Telamonian Ajax answering addressed: “Idæus, order Hector to
speak these words, for he challenged all the bravest [of our side] to
battle. Let him begin, and I will entirely obey, if indeed he does so.”</p>
<p>But him crest-tossing Hector addressed in turn: “Ajax, since some god
has given thee size, and might, and prudence, and thou art the most
excellent of the Greeks at the spear, let us now cease from battle and
contest for this day; hereafter will we fight again, till the Deity
shall separate us, and give the victory to either. Now night is

mutually give very glorious gifts, that some one of the Greeks and

<p>Thus then having spoken, he gave him a silver-studded sword, presenting
it with the sheath and the well-wrought belt. But Ajax gave [to him] a
belt, splendid with purple. Then they twain being separated, the one
went to the people of the Greeks, and the other to the crowd of the
Trojans: and they rejoiced when they saw him coming alive and safe,
having escaped the strength and the invincible hands of Ajax; and led
him to the city, not having had any hopes that he was safe. But the
well-greaved Greeks, on the other hand, led away Ajax, rejoicing in
victory, to divine Agamemnon. When now they were in the tents of the son
of Atreus, then Agamemnon, king of men, sacrificed for them an ox, a
male, five years old, to the most powerful son of Saturn. This they
flayed, and dressed it; made divisions of the whole of it, and skilfully
divided these into smaller portions, and fixed them on spits, and
roasted them very cleverly, and drew off all. But when they had ceased
from labour, and had prepared the banquet, they feasted, nor did their
soul in anywise lack a due proportion of the feast. The valiant son of
Atreus, far-ruling Agamemnon, honoured Ajax with an entire chine.<span id="footnotetag261"/>

But when they had dismissed the desire of drink and of food, for them
the aged man Nestor first of all began to frame advice, whose counsel
before also had appeared the best, who, wisely counselling, harangued
them, and said:</p>

   viii. 181. Cf. Xenoph. Rep. Lac. XV. 4.</p>
<p>“Son of Atreus, and ye other chiefs of all the Greeks, many of the
long-haired Achæans have perished, whose black blood fierce Mars has now
shed near fair-flowing Scamander, and their souls have descended to the
shades! Therefore it behoves you to cause the battle of the Greeks to
cease with the dawn, and let us, collected together, carry the bodies
hither on chariots, with oxen and mules, and burn them at a little
distance from the ships, that each may carry home the bones [of the
deceased] to their children, when we return again to our father-land.
And let us, going out, heap up in the plain one common tomb for all,
round the pyre, and beside it let us speedily erect lofty towers, as a
bulwark of our ships and of ourselves; and in it let us make a
well-fitted gate, that through it there may be a passage for the
chariots. But outside let us sink, near at hand, a deep trench, which,
being circular, may serve as a defence to both steeds and men, lest at
any time the war of the haughty Trojans should press sorely.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, and all the princes approved of his counsel. But of the
Trojans also was a panic-struck and turbulent council held in the lofty
citadel of Ilium, at the gates of Priam; and to them wise Antenor thus
began to harangue:</p>
<p>“Hear me, ye Trojans and Dardanians and allies, that I may tell you what
the soul in my breast commands me. Come then, let us restore Argive
Helen, and her treasures with her to the sons of Atreus to lead away;
for now we are fighting after having violated the faithful leagues.
Wherefore I think that nothing better will be brought to pass by us,
unless we act thus.”</p>
<p>He, having thus said, sat down; but to them arose divine Alexander, the
husband of fair-haired Helen, who answering him spoke winged words:</p>
<p>“O Antenor, thou no longer speakest these things grateful to me. Thou
knowest how to devise another counsel better than this; but if, in
truth, thou speakest this seriously, the gods themselves have now
deprived thee of thy senses. But I will declare my opinion amidst the
horse-subduing Trojans; I openly declare I will not give up my wife: but
the treasures, whatever I have brought home from Argos, all these I am
willing to give, and even to add others from my own home.”</p>
<p>Thus having spoken, he sat down; but to them arose Priam, son of
Dardanus, a counsellor equal to the gods; who thus wisely harangued
them, and said:</p>
<p>“Hear me, ye Trojans, and Dardanians, and allies, that I may tell you
what the soul in my breast commands. Now take repast through the army,
as heretofore, and be attentive to the watch, and let each be mindful of
guard. But in the morning let Idæus proceed to the hollow ships, to
announce to the sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus, the resolution
of Alexander, on whose account the contention has arisen; and let him
add this prudent request also, whether they wish to desist from
horrid-sounding war, until we burn the dead; afterwards will we fight
again till fate separate us, and give the victory to one or other of
us.”</p>
<p>Thus he said: but they heard him very attentively, and obeyed. Then they
took their repast throughout the city, by companies. In the morning
Idæus went to the hollow ships. He found the Greeks, the servants of
Mars, in council, at the stern of<span id="footnotetag262"/>

clear-voiced herald, standing in the midst of them, spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Ye sons of Atreus, and ye other chiefs of all the Greeks, Priam and the
other illustrious Trojans command me to tell you, if it be agreeable and
pleasing to you, the determination of Alexander, on whose account this
contention has arisen.”</p>

<p>“Whatever treasures Alexander brought in the hollow ships to Troy, (would
that he first had perished,) all these is he willing to give up, and
even to add others from his own home: but he says that he will not
restore the wedded spouse of glorious Menelaus: certainly the Trojans,
at least, advise him. They also order me to make this proposal, to wit,
whether ye are willing to desist from dreadful-sounding war, until we
shall burn the dead: afterwards we shall fight again, till fate separate
us, and give the victory to one of us.”</p>
<p>Thus he said, but they all became mute in silence. At length Diomede,
brave in the din of war, spoke thus amongst them:</p>
<p>“Let none now receive the treasures of Alexander, nor Helen: for it is
plain, even [to him] who is a mere infant, that the issues of
destruction impend over the Trojans.”</p>
<p>Thus he said, and all the sons of the Greeks shouted, admiring the words
of horse-breaking Diomede: and then Agamemnon, king of men, thus
addressed Idæus:</p>
<p>“Idæus, thou thyself hearest, indeed, the sentiments of the Greeks, how
they answer thee; and such also pleases me. But concerning the dead, I
grudge not that [you] should burn them; for there is no grudge towards
the dead bodies, when they are dead, hastily to perform their obsequies
with fire:<span id="footnotetag263"/>

witness of the treaties.”</p>

(return) </a> Literally, “to appease [the dead].”</p>
<p>Thus having said, he raised his sceptre to all the gods. But Idæus
returned to sacred Ilium. And the Trojans and Dardanians all sat
assembled in council, expecting when Idæus might return. He came, and
declared his message, standing in the midst of them. But they prepared
themselves very speedily for both purposes, some to carry away the
bodies, and others to gather wood. The Greeks also on the other side
hastened from their well-benched ships, some to carry away the bodies,
and others to collect wood.</p>
<p>Then, indeed, the sun freshly struck the fields [with its rays],
ascending heaven from the calmly-flowing, deep-moving ocean. But they
met one another. Then was it difficult to distinguish each man [amongst
the slain]; but washing off with water the bloody gore, and pouring over
them warm tears, they placed them upon the chariots; nor did mighty
Priam suffer them to give way to grief. In silence, therefore, they
heaped the bodies on the pile, grieving at heart. But when they had
burned them in the fire, they returned to sacred Ilium. In like manner
also, on the other side, the well-greaved Greeks heaped the bodies on
the pile, grieving in their heart; and having burned them with fire,
they returned to the hollow ships. And when it was not yet morning, but
still twilight, then a chosen band of Greeks arose about the pile; and
going out from the plain, they made around it one common tomb, and near
it they built a wall and lofty towers, a bulwark of their ships and of
themselves. In them they made well-fitted gates, that through them there
might be a passage for the chariots. Without they dug a deep ditch, near
it, broad and large, and in it fixed palisades. Thus the long-haired
Greeks on their part laboured.</p>
<p>But the gods on the contrary sitting beside the thundering Jove, were
admiring the mighty work of the brazen-mailed Greeks; but to them
Neptune, the earth-shaker, thus began to speak:</p>
<p>“O father Jove, is there any mortal on the boundless earth, who will any
more disclose his mind and counsel to the immortals? Dost thou not
perceive how the long-haired Greeks have built a wall before their
shipping, and have drawn a ditch all round, nor have they given splendid
hecatombs to the gods? The fame of this [work] will certainly be
wherever light is diffused: but they will forget that [wall] which I and
Phœbus Apollo, toiling, built round the city for the hero
Laomedon.” <span id="footnotetag264"/>

<p>Him, greatly enraged, the cloud-compelling Jove addressed:</p>
<p>“Ha! thou far-ruling earth-shaker, what hast thou said? Another of the
gods, who is much weaker than thou in hands and in might might have
dreaded this idea; but thy glory shall assuredly extend as far as light
is diffused. Howbeit, when the crest-waving Greeks shall have departed
with their ships into their dear fatherland, do thou, overthrowing this
wall, sink it all in the deep, and again cover the great shore with
sand. Thus may this mighty rampart of the Greeks be wholly effaced.”</p>

<p>Thus were they conversing on such matters among themselves. But the sun
had set, and the work of the Greeks was finished. They slaughtered oxen
through the tents, and took their repast. Many ships (which Euneüs, son
of Jason, whom Hypsipyle bore to Jason, shepherd of the people, sent,)
arrived from Lemnos, bringing wine. The son of Jason gave of wine a
thousand measures, to be brought separately, as a gift to the sons of
Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus. Thence the long-haired Greeks
bought<span id="footnotetag265"/>

hides, some for the oxen themselves, and some for slaves; and they
prepared an abundant feast. Through the whole night, indeed, the
long-haired Greeks feasted; and the Trojans too, and their allies,
through the city. And all night thundering fearfully, provident Jove was
devising evils for both parties; but pale fear seized them. And they
poured wine from their cups on the earth, nor did any one dare to drink
before he had made a libation to the supreme son of Saturn. They then
lay down, and enjoyed the boon of sleep.</p>
