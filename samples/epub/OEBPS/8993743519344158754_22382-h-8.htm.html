<h2>BOOK THE EIGHTH.</h2>
<h4 id="pgepubid00022">ARGUMENT.</h4>
<p>Jove assembles the gods, and forbids them to interfere between the
Greeks and Trojans. He then repairs to Ida, where, having consulted the
scales of destiny, he directs his lightning against the Greeks. Nestor,
in the chariot of Diomede, goes against Hector, whose charioteer is
slain by Diomede. Jove again interposes his thunders, and the Greeks
seek refuge within the rampart. Upon a favourable omen accompanying the
prayer of Agamemnon, Diomede and the rest set out, and Teucer performs
great exploits, but is disabled by Hector. Juno and Minerva are
prevented interfering by Jove, and Hector takes measures to insure the
safety of Troy during the night.</p>
<p class="p2">
Now did saffron-mantled morn diffuse herself over all the earth, and
thunder-rejoicing Jove made an assembly of the gods on the highest peak
of many-topped Olympus. And he himself harangued them, and all the other
deities hearkened (to his command):<span id="footnotetag266"/>

<p>“Hear me, all ye gods and all ye goddesses, that I may tell you what the
soul in my breast prompts me. Let no female deity, therefore, nor any
male, attempt to infringe this my injunction; but do ye all at once
assent, that I may very speedily bring these matters to their issue.
Whomsoever of the gods I shall discover, having gone apart from [the
rest], wishing to aid either the Trojans or the Greeks, disgracefully
smitten shall he return to Olympus: or seizing, I will hurl him into
gloomy Tartarus, very far hence, where there is a very deep gulf beneath
the earth, and iron portals, and a brazen threshold, as far below Hades
as heaven is from earth;<span id="footnotetag267"/>

most powerful of all the gods. But come, ye gods, and try me, that ye
may all know. Having suspended a golden chain from heaven, do all ye
gods and goddesses suspend yourselves therefrom; yet would ye not draw
down from heaven to earth your supreme counsellor Jove, not even if ye
labour ever so much: but whenever I, desiring, should wish to pull it, I
could draw it up together, earth, and ocean, and all: then, indeed,
would I bind the chain around the top of Olympus, and all these should
hang aloft. By so much do I surpass both gods and men.” <span id="footnotetag268"/>

(return) </a> Referring to this address of Jove, Coleridge
   remarks: “Although the supremacy of Jove comes far short of the
   true conception of almighty power, the characteristic point which
   seems to be fairly established is, that he is the active and
   ruling power of the popular mythology, the supreme and despotic
   chief of an aristocracy of weaker divinities, accustomed to
   consult with them and liable to their opposition and even
   violence, yet, upon the whole, substantially aristocratic, and
   independent of any recognized permanent superior.”—Classic
   Poets, p. 159.</p>
<p>Thus he said. But they all became mute in silence, wondering at his
speech; for he spoke very menacingly. But at length the azure-eyed
goddess Minerva thus spoke in the midst:</p>
<p>“O sire of ours! son of Saturn! most supreme of kings! well do we all
know that thy strength is irresistible: yet do we truly mourn for the
warlike Greeks, who are now perishing, fulfilling their evil fate. But
nevertheless, we will refrain from war, since thus thou commandest. Yet
will we suggest counsel to the Greeks, which will avail them, that they
may not all perish because thou art wrathful.”</p>
<p>But her the cloud-impelling Jove smiling addressed: “Be of good cheer,
Tritonia, my dear daughter—I speak not with a serious intent; but I am
willing to be lenient towards thee.”</p>
<p>Thus having said, under his chariot he yoked his brazen-footed,
swift-flying steeds, adorned with golden manes. He himself put on gold
about his person, and took his golden well-made whip, and ascended the
chariot; and lashed them on to proceed, and they, not unwilling, flew
midway between the earth and starry heaven. He came to spring-fed Ida,
the mother of wild beasts, to Gargarus, where he had a consecrated
enclosure, and a fragrant altar. There the father of gods and men
stopped his steeds, having loosed them from the chariot, and poured a
thick haze around. But he sat upon the summits, exulting in glory,
looking upon the city of the Trojans and the ships of the Greeks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the long-haired Greeks were taking their repast in a hurried
manner through the tents, and after that they put on their armour. But
the Trojans, on the other side, were arming themselves through the city,
fewer in number; yet even thus, they were eager to fight in battle,
compelled by necessity, in defence of their children and their wives.
And the gates were opened wide, and the forces rushed out, both chariot
warriors and foot, and much tumult arose. But when these collecting
together came into one place, they clashed together shields and spears,
and the might of brazen-mailed men; but the bossy shields approached one
another, and much tumult arose. There at the same time were both
lamentation and boasting of men destroying and destroyed, and the earth
flowed with blood. As long as the forenoon lasted, and the sacred day
was in progress, so long did the weapons touch both, and the people
fell. But when the sun had ascended the middle heaven, then at length
did Father Jove raise the golden scales, and placed in them two
destinies of long-reposing death, [the destinies] both of the
horse-breaking Trojans and of the brazen-mailed Greeks, and holding them
in the middle, he poised them; but the fatal day of the Greeks inclined
low. The destinies of the Greeks, indeed, rested on the bounteous earth,
but those of the Trojans on the contrary were elevated to the wide
heaven.</p>
<p>But he himself mightily thundered from Ida, and sent his burning
lightning against the army of the Greeks: they having seen it, were
amazed, and pale fear seized them all. Then neither Idomeneus, nor
Agamemnon, nor the two Ajaces, the servants of Mars, dared to remain.
Gerenian Nestor alone, the guardian of the Greeks, remained, not
willingly, but one of his horses was disabled, which noble Alexander,
husband of fair-haired Helen, had pierced with an arrow in the top of
the forehead, where the forelocks of horses grow out of the head, and is
most fatal.<span id="footnotetag269"/>

brain; and he disordered the [other] horses, writhing round the brazen
barb. Whilst the old man hastening, was cutting away the side reins of
the horse with his sword, then were the swift steeds of Hector coming
through the crowd, bearing the bold charioteer Hector. And then the old
man would certainly have lost his life, if Diomede, brave in the din of
battle, had not quickly observed it; and he shouted, dreadfully
exhorting Ulysses, [thus]:</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote269"/><b>Footnote 269:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-8.htm.html#footnotetag269" class="pginternal">
(return) </a> Or “opportune” viz for inflicting a fatal
   wound.—Kennedy.</p>
<p>“Jove-born son of Laërtes, much-contriving Ulysses, whither dost thou
fly, turning thy back in the throng, like a coward? [Beware], lest some
man with a spear transpierce thee in the back, flying. But stay, that we
may repel the fierce hero from the aged man.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke: but much-enduring, noble Ulysses heard him not, but
passed by to the hollow ships of the Greeks. But the son of Tydeus,
though being alone, was mixed with the van, and stood before the steeds
of the aged son of Neleus, and addressing him, spoke winged words:</p>
<p>“O old man, certainly the youthful warriors greatly oppress thee: but
thy strength is relaxed, and tiresome old age attends thee: thy servant
is exhausted, and thy steeds are slow. But come, ascend my chariot, that
thou mayest see what kind are the steeds of Tros, skilled to fly and to
pursue very rapidly, here and there, through the plain; which lately I
took from Æneas, authors of flight. Let the attendants take care of
those steeds [of thine], but let us direct these against the
horse-breaking Trojans, that even Hector may know whether my spear also
rages madly in my hands.” Thus he said: but the Gerenian knight Nestor
disobeyed him not. Accordingly, at once their attendants, brave
Sthenelus and valorous Eurymedon, took care of Nestor’s steeds: and the
two chiefs ascended the chariot of Diomede. Nestor took the shining
reins in his hands, and lashed the steeds, and soon they came near
Hector. At him rushing impetuously forward, the son of Tydeus launched a
spear; but the weapon missed him, and struck his attendant charioteer in
the breast, near the pap, who was holding the reins of the steeds,
Eniopeus, the son of magnanimous Thebæus: but he fell from the chariot,
and the swift steeds started back, and there his soul and his strength
were dissolved. But excessive grief overshadowed Hector in his mind, on
account of [the loss of] his charioteer. There, though grieving for his
companion, he let him lie, and sought a bold charioteer: nor did his
steeds long want a guide; for soon he found courageous Archeptolemus,
the son of Iphitus, whom then he made to mount the swift-footed steeds,
and gave the reins into his hands.</p>
<p>Then, indeed, had slaughter arisen, and dreadful deeds had been done,
and [the Trojans] had been pent up in Ilium like lambs, had not the
father of both men and gods quickly perceived it. Therefore, dreadfully
thundering he sent forth his glowing thunderbolt, and cast it into the
earth before the steeds of Diomede: but there arose a terrible flame of
burning sulphur, and the two frightened steeds crouched trembling
beneath the chariot. Moreover, the beautiful reins fell from the hands
of Nestor, and he feared in his soul, and addressed Diomede:</p>
<p>“Son of Tydeus, come now, turn thy solid-hoofed steeds to flight. Dost
thou not perceive that victory from Jove does not attend thee? For now,
this very day, of a truth, Saturnian Jove awards him glory; afterwards
again will he give it to us, if he shall be willing. By no means can a
man impede the will of Jove, not even a very mighty one; since he is by
far the most powerful.”</p>
<p>But him Diomede, brave in the din of war, then answered: “Old man,
certainly thou hast said all this rightly: but this grievous sorrow
invades my heart and my soul: for Hector at some time will say,
haranguing amongst the Trojans, ‘The son of Tydeus, routed by me, fled
to his ships.’ Thus at some time will he boast: but then may the earth
yawn wide for me.”</p>
<p>But him the Gerenian knight Nestor then answered: “Alas! warlike son of
Tydeus, what hast thou said? Even though Hector call thee coward and
unwarlike, yet the Trojans and Dardanians, and the wives of the
stout-hearted shield-bearing Trojans, whose vigorous husbands thou hast
prostrated in the dust, will not believe him.”</p>
<p>Thus having said, he turned the solid-hoofed steeds to flight, back into
the crowd. But the Trojans and Hector, with a mighty shout, poured
destructive missiles upon them. And then after him loud roared mighty
crest-tossing Hector:</p>
<p>“Son of Tydeus, the swift-horsed Greeks honoured thee, indeed, above
[others] with a seat, with meat, and full cups; but now will they
dishonour thee; for thou hast become like a woman. Away! timorous girl!
since thou shalt never climb our towers, I giving way, nor bear away our
women in thy ships; first shall I give thee thy doom.”</p>
<p>Thus he said; but the son of Tydeus debated whether to turn his steeds,
and to fight against him. Thrice, indeed, he thought in mind and soul,
but thrice, on the other hand, the provident Jove thundered from the
Idæan mountains, giving a signal to the Trojans, the alternating success
of battle. But Hector exhorted the Trojans, vociferating aloud:</p>
<p>“Ye Trojans and Lycians, and close-fighting Dardanians, be men, my
friends, and be mindful of impetuous might! I know the son of Saturn
hath willingly accorded me victory and great renown, but to the Greeks
destruction. Fools, who indeed built those weak, worthless walls, which
shall not check my strength; but our steeds will easily overleap the dug
trench. But when, indeed, I come to their hollow ships, then let there
be some memory of burning fire, that I may consume their fleet with the
flame, and slay the Argives themselves at the ships, bewildered by the
smoke.”</p>
<p>Thus having spoken, he cheered on his steeds, and said: “Xanthus, and
thou Podargus, and Æthon, and noble Lampus, now repay to me the
attention, with which, in great abundance, Andromache, the daughter of
magnanimous Eetion, gave to you the sweet barley, mixing wine also [for
you] to drink, whenever your mind ordered it, even before me, who boast
to be her vigorous husband. But follow and hasten, that we may take the
shield of Nestor, the fame of which has now reached the heaven, that it
is entirely golden, the handles and itself: but, from the shoulders of
horse-breaking Diomede, the well-made corslet, which the artist Vulcan
wrought. If we can take these, I expect that the Greeks this very night
will ascend their swift ships.”</p>
<p>Thus he said boasting; but venerable Juno was indignant, and shook
herself on her throne, and made great Olympus tremble; and openly
accosted the mighty deity, Neptune:</p>
<p>“Alas! far-ruling Earth-shaker, dost thou not in thy soul pity the
perishing Greeks? But they bring thee many and grateful gifts to Helice
and Ægæ. Do thou, therefore, will to them the victory. For if we were
willing, as many of us as are assistants to the Greeks, to repulse the
Trojans and restrain far-sounding Jove, then might he grieve sitting
alone there on Ida.”</p>
<p>But her king Neptune, greatly excited, thus addressed: “Juno,
petulant<span id="footnotetag270"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-8.htm.html#footnote270" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">270</sup></a> in speech, what hast thou said? I would not wish, indeed,
that we, the other gods, should fight with Saturnian Jove, since he is
by far most powerful.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote270"/><b>Footnote 270:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-8.htm.html#footnotetag270" class="pginternal">

<p>Thus indeed were they holding such converse with each other. But
whatever space before the ships the trench belonging to the tower
enclosed, was filled with horses and shielded men crowded together.<span id="footnotetag271"/>

But Hector, the son of Priam, equal to swift Mars, had crowded them
thus, when Jupiter awarded him glory. And now would he have burned the
equal ships with blazing fire, had not venerable Juno put it into the
soul of Agamemnon, himself actively engaged, briskly to urge on the
Greeks. He therefore hastened to go along the tents and ships of the
Greeks, holding in his stout hand his great purple robe. But in the huge
black ship of Ulysses he stood, which was in the midst, that he might
shout audibly to either side, as well to the tent of Telamonian Ajax, as
to that of Achilles, for they had drawn up their equal ships at the
extremities of the line, relying on their valour and the strength of
their hands. Then he shouted distinctly, calling upon the Greeks:</p>
<p>“Shame! ye Greeks, foul subjects of disgrace! gallant in form [alone]!
Where are those boastings gone, when we professed ourselves the bravest;
those which, once in Lemnos, vain braggarts! ye did utter, eating much
flesh of horned oxen, and drinking-goblets crowned with wine,<span id="footnotetag272"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-8.htm.html#footnote272" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">272</sup></a> that
each would in battle be equivalent to a hundred and even two hundred of
the Trojans? But now, indeed, we are not equal to Hector alone, who
shortly will burn our ships with flaming fire. Ο father Jove, hast thou
indeed ever yet afflicted with such destruction any one of mighty kings,
and so deprived him of high renown? And yet I say that I never passed by
thy fair altar in my many-benched ship, coming here with ill luck.<span id="footnotetag273"/>

But on all I burned the fat of oxen and the thighs, desiring to sack
well-walled Troy. But, Ο Jove, accomplish for me this vow, at least
permit us to escape and get away; nor suffer the Greeks to be thus
subdued by the Trojans.”</p>

Jove.</p>
<p>When, therefore, they saw that the bird had come from Jove, they rushed
the more against the Trojans, and were mindful of battle. Then none of
the Greeks, numerous as they were, could have boasted that he had driven
his swift steeds before Diomede, and urged them beyond the ditch, and
fought against [the enemy]; for far the first he slew a helmeted Trojan
hero, Agelaus, son of Phradmon. He, indeed, was turning his horses for
flight; but as he was turning, Diomede fixed his spear in his back,
between his shoulders, and drove it through his breast. He fell from his
chariot, and his arms rattled upon him. After him the sons of Atreus,
Agamemnon and Menelaus; after them the Ajaces, clad in impetuous valour;
after them, Idomeneus and Meriones, the armour-bearer of Idomeneus,
equal to man-slaughtering Mars; and after them Eurypylus, the

sheltered himself beneath Ajax, and he covered him with his splendid
shield. Then what Trojan first did blameless Teucer slay? Orsilochus
first, and Ormenus, and Ophelestes, and Dætor, and Chromius, and godlike
Lycophontes, and Amopaon, son of Polyæmon, and Melanippus—all, one
after the other, he stretched upon the bounteous earth. But Agamemnon,
king of men, rejoiced at seeing him destroying the phalanxes of the
Trojans with his stout bow. And advancing near him he stood, and thus
addressed him:</p>

<p>But him blameless Teucer answering, addressed: “Most glorious son of

strength, do I loiter: but from the time we have driven the Trojans
towards Ilium, since that period have I slain men, intercepting them
with my shafts. Already have I discharged eight long-bearded arrows, and
they have all been fixed in the bodies of warlike youths; but I cannot
strike this raging dog.”</p>

for his mind was eager to strike him; and him indeed he missed: but in
the breast he struck blameless Gorgythion with an arrow, the brave son
of Priam. Him his fair mother Castianira, like unto a goddess in person,
brought forth, being wedded from Æsyma. And as a poppy, which in the
garden is weighed down with fruit and vernal showers, droops its head to
one side, so did his head incline aside, depressed by the helmet. But
Teucer discharged another arrow from the string against Hector, for his
mind longed to strike him. Yet even then he missed, for Apollo warded
off the shaft: but he struck in the breast, near the pap, Archeptolemus,
the bold charioteer of Hector, rushing to battle: and he fell from his
chariot, and his swift steeds sprang back. There his soul and strength
were dissolved. But sad grief darkened the mind of Hector, on account of
his charioteer. Then indeed he left him, although grieved for his
companion, and ordered his brother Cebriones, being near, to take the
reins of the steeds; but he was not disobedient, having heard him. Then
[Hector] himself leaped from his all-shining chariot to the ground,
roaring dreadfully: and he seized a large stone in his hand, and went
straight against Teucer, for his mind encouraged him to strike him. He
on his part took out a bitter arrow from his quiver, and applied it to
the string: but him, on the other hand, near the shoulder, where the
collar-bone separates the neck and breast, and it is a particularly
fatal spot, there, as he was drawing back [the bow], the active warrior
Hector<span id="footnotetag281"/>

him. He broke his bowstring, and his hand was numbed at the wrist-joint.
Falling on his knees he stood, and the bow dropped from his hands. But
Ajax did not neglect his fallen brother; for running up, he protected
him, and stretched his shield before him. Afterwards his two dear
companions, Mecistheus, son of Echius, and noble Alastor, coming up,
carried him, groaning heavily, to the hollow ships.</p>

<p>But again did Olympian Jove rouse the strength of the Trojans; and they
drove back the Greeks straight to the deep foss. But Hector went in the
van, looking grim through ferocity; as when some dog, relying on his
swift feet, seizes from the rear a wild boar or lion on the haunch and
buttocks, and marks him as he turns: so Hector hung on the rear of the
long-haired Greeks, always slaying the hindmost: and they fled. But when
they flying had passed through the stakes and the foss, and many were
subdued beneath the hands of the Trojans, they, on the one hand,
remaining at the ships were restrained, and having exhorted one another,
and raised their hands to all the gods, they prayed each with a loud
voice. But, on the other hand, Hector, having the eyes of a Gorgon, or
of man-slaughtering Mars, drove round his beauteous-maned steeds in all
directions.</p>
<p>But them [the Greeks] white-armed goddess Juno having beheld, pitied
them, and thus straightway to Minerva addressed winged words:</p>
<p>“Alas! daughter of ægis-bearing Jove, shall we no longer be anxious
about the perishing Greeks, although in extremity;—who now, indeed,
fulfilling evil fate, are perishing by the violence of one man? for
Hector, the son of Priam, rages, no longer to be endured, and already
has he done many evils.”</p>
<p>But her the azure-eyed goddess Minerva in turn addressed: “And beyond
doubt this warrior would have lost his vigour and his life, destroyed by
the hands of the Greeks in his fatherland, were it not that this my sire
rages with no sound mind; cruel, ever unjust, a counteractor of my
efforts. Nor does he remember aught of my services, that I have very
often preserved his son, when oppressed by the labours of Eurystheus. He
truly wept to heaven; but me Jove sent down from heaven to aid him. But
had I known this in my prudent<span id="footnotetag282"/>

dwelling] of the gaoler Pluto to drag from Erebus the dog of hateful
Pluto, he had not escaped the profound stream of the Stygian wave. But
now, indeed, he hates me, and prefers the wish of Thetis, who kissed his
knees, and took his beard in her hand, beseeching him to honour
city-destroying Achilles, The time will be when he will again call me
his dear Minerva. But do thou now harness for us thy solid-hoofed
steeds, while I, having entered the palace of ægis-bearing Jove, equip
myself with arms for war, that I may see whether crest-tossing Hector,
the son of Priam, will rejoice at us, as I appear in the walks<span id="footnotetag283"/>

war. Certainly also some one of the Trojans will satiate the dogs and
birds with his fat and flesh, having fallen at the ships of the Greeks.”</p>

<p>Thus she said: nor did the white-armed goddess Juno disobey her. Juno,
on her part, venerable goddess, daughter of mighty Saturn, running in
haste, caparisoned the golden-bridled steeds. But Minerva, the daughter
of ægis-bearing Jove, let fall upon the pavement of her father her
beauteous variegated robe, which she had wrought and laboured with her
own hands. But she, having put on the coat of mail of cloud-compelling
Jove, was equipped in armour for the tearful war. She mounted her
flaming chariot on her feet, and took her heavy, huge, sturdy spear,
with which she is wont to subdue the ranks of heroic men, with
whomsoever she, sprung from a powerful sire, is enraged. But Juno with
the lash speedily urged on the steeds. The portals of heaven opened
spontaneously, which the Hours<span id="footnotetag284"/>

great heaven and Olympus, either to open the dense cloud, or to close
it. Then through these they guided their goaded steeds.</p>

<p>But father Jove, when he beheld them from Ida, was grievously enraged,
and roused golden-winged Iris to bear this message:</p>
<p>“Away, depart, swift Iris, turn them back, nor suffer them to come
against me; for we shall not advantageously engage in battle. For thus I
speak, and it shall moreover be accomplished, I will lame their swift
steeds under their chariot, dislodge them from the chariot, and break
the chariot; nor for ten revolving years shall ye be healed of the
wounds which the thunderbolt shall inflict: that Minerva may know when
she may be fighting with her sire. But with Juno I am neither so
indignant nor so angry; for she is ever accustomed to counteract me, in
whatever I intend.”</p>
<p>Thus he said: but Iris, swift as the storm, hastened to bear the
message. Down from the Idæan mountains she went to great Olympus:
meeting them in the foremost gates of many-valleyed Olympus, she
restrained them, and pronounced to them the message of Jove:</p>
<p>“Where do ye go? Why does your soul rage in your breasts? The sun of
Saturn does not suffer you to aid the Greeks. For thus has the son of
Saturn threatened, and he will assuredly perform it, to lame your swift
steeds under your chariot, and dislodge yourselves from the chariot, and
break the chariot; nor for ten revolving years shall ye be healed of the
wounds which his thunderbolt shall inflict: that thou, Ο Azure-eyed,
mayest know when thou art fighting with thy sire. But with Juno he is
neither so indignant nor so angry; for she is always accustomed to
counteract him in whatever he devises. But thou, most insolent and
audacious hound! if thou in reality shalt dare to raise thy mighty spear
against Jove—” <span id="footnotetag285"/>

<p>Thus indeed having said, swift-footed Iris departed. Then Juno addressed
these words to Minerva:</p>
<p>“Alas! daughter of ægis-bearing Jove, I cannot any longer suffer that we
ourselves shall fight against Jove, on account of mortals. Of whom let
one perish, and let another live, whoever may chance. But let him,
meditating his own affairs in his mind, adjudicate to the Trojans and
the Greeks as is fair.”</p>
<p>Thus then having said, she turned back the solid-hoofed steeds. The
Hours unyoked for them the fair-maned steeds, and bound them to the
ambrosial mangers; but they tilted the chariots against the splendid
walls. But they themselves sat, mingled with the other deities, on their
golden couches, sad at heart.</p>
<p>Then father Jove drove his beauteous-wheeled chariot and steeds from Ida
to Olympus, and came to the seats of the gods. His horses, indeed, the
illustrious Earth-shaker loosed, but he laid the chariot on its support,
spreading a linen coverlet [over it]. But loud-sounding Jove himself sat
on his golden throne, and mighty Olympus was shaken under his feet. But
Minerva and Juno by themselves sat apart from Jove, nor did they at all
address him, nor question him. But he knew in his mind, and said:</p>
<p>“Why are ye so sad, Minerva and Juno? Indeed, ye have not laboured long
in glorious battle to destroy the Trojans, against whom ye have taken
grievous hatred. Not all the gods in Olympus could altogether turn me to
flight, such are my strength and my invincible hands. But trembling
seized the shining limbs of both of you, before ye saw battle, and the
destructive deeds of war. For so I tell you, which would also have been
performed: no more should ye, stricken with my thunder, have returned in
your chariots to Olympus, where are the seats of the immortals.”</p>
<p>Thus he said: but Minerva and Juno murmured. They sat near each other,
and were devising evils for the Trojans.</p>
<p>Minerva, indeed, was silent, nor said anything, angry with father Jove,
for wild rage possessed her. But Juno contained not her wrath in her
breast, but addressed him:</p>
<p>“Most terrible son of Saturn, what hast thou said? Well do we know that
thy might is invincible: yet do we lament the warlike Greeks, who will
now perish, fulfilling their evil destiny. But nevertheless, we will
desist from war, if thou desirest it. But we will suggest counsel to the
Greeks, which will avail them, that they may not all perish, thou being
wrathful.”</p>
<p>But her cloud-compelling Jove answering, addressed: “To-morrow, if thou
wilt, O venerable, large-eyed Juno, thou shalt behold the very powerful
son of Saturn even with greater havoc destroying the mighty army of the
warlike Greeks. For warlike Hector will not cease from battle before
that he arouse the swift-footed son of Peleus at the ships. On that day,
when they indeed are fighting at the ships, in a very narrow pass, for
Patroclus fallen. For thus is it fated. But I do not make account of
thee enraged, not if thou shouldst go to the furthest limits of land and
ocean, where Iapetus and Saturn sitting, are delighted neither with the
splendour of the sun that journeys on high, nor with the winds; but
profound Tartarus [is] all around—not even if wandering, thou shouldst
go there, have I regard for thee enraged, since there is nothing more
impudent than thou.”</p>
<p>Thus he said: but white-armed Juno answered nought. And the bright light
of the sun fell into the ocean, drawing dark night over the fruitful
earth.<span id="footnotetag286"/>

<p>But illustrious Hector then formed a council of the Trojans, having led
them apart from the ships, at the eddying river, in a clear space, where
the place appeared free from dead bodies. But alighting to the ground
from their horses, they listened to the speech which Hector, beloved of
Jove, uttered. In his hand he held a spear of eleven cubits: and before
him shone the golden point of the spear, and a golden ring surrounded
it. Leaning on this, he spoke winged words:</p>
<p>“Hear me, ye Trojans, and Dardanians, and allies: I lately thought that
having destroyed the ships and all the Greeks, I should return back to
wind-swept Ilium. But darkness has come on first, which has now been
the chief means of preserving the Greeks and their ships on the shore of
the sea. But, however, let us now obey dark night, and make ready our
repasts; and do ye loose from your chariots your beautiful-maned steeds,
and set fodder before them: and quickly bring from the city oxen and fat
sheep; bring sweet wine and bread from your homes; and besides collect
many fagots, that all night till Aurora, mother of dawn, we may kindle
many fires, and the splendour may ascend to heaven: lest haply in the
night the long-haired Greeks attempt to fly over the broad ridge of the
ocean. That they may not at all events without toil and without harm
ascend their ships: but [let us] take care that each of them may have to
heal a wound<span id="footnotetag287"/>

a sharp spear, bounding into his ship; that every other too may dread to
wage tearful war against the horse-breaking Trojans. Let the heralds,
dear to Jove, proclaim through the city, that the youths at the age of
puberty, and the hoary-templed sages, keep watch around the city, in the
god-built turrets; and let the females also, the feebler sex, in their
halls each kindle a mighty fire: and let there be some strong guard,
lest a secret band enter the city, the people being absent. Thus let it
be, magnanimous Trojans, as I say: and let the speech, which is now most
salutary, be thus spoken. But for that which will be [most expedient] in
the morning, I will [then] speak amongst the horse-breaking Trojans.
Making vows both to Jove and to the other gods, I hope to banish hence
those dogs borne hither by the fates, whom the fates bear in their black
ships.<span id="footnotetag288"/>

me back from the ships to our walls, or whether I shall bear away his
bloody spoils, having slain him with my brazen spear. To-morrow shall he
make manifest his valour, if he shall withstand my assaulting spear. But
I think that he will lie wounded amongst the first at sunrise to-morrow,
and many companions around him. Would that I were so certainly immortal,
and free from old age all my days, and honoured, as Minerva and Apollo

<p>Thus Hector harangued them; but the Trojans applauded aloud. And they
loosed from the yoke their sweating steeds, and bound them with halters,
each to his own chariot. Quickly they brought from the city oxen and fat
sheep: and they brought sweet wine, and bread from their homes, and also
collected many fagots. But the winds raised the savour from the plain to
heaven.</p>

fires blazed for them. As when in heaven the stars appear very

without a breeze, and all the pointed rocks and lofty summits and groves
appear, but in heaven the immense æther is disclosed, and all the stars

the Trojans kindling them appear before Ilium, between the ships and the
streams of Xanthus. A thousand fires blazed in the plain, and by each
sat fifty men, at the light of the blazing fire. But their steeds eating
white barley and oats, standing by the chariots, awaited
beautiful-throned Aurora.</p>
