<h2>BOOK THE NINTH.</h2>
<h4 id="pgepubid00024">ARGUMENT.</h4>
<p>By advice of Nestor, Agamemnon sends Ulysses, Phœnix, and Ajax, to the
tent of Achilles to sue for a reconciliation. Notwithstanding the
earnest appeal of Phœnix, their errand proves fruitless.</p>

   Ionia. Heyne, however, observes, “comparatio e mente poetæ
   instituitur, non ex Agamemnonis persona.”</p>
<p>But Atrides, wounded to the heart with great sorrow, kept going round,
giving orders to the clear-voiced heralds, to summon each man by name to
an assembly, but not to call aloud; and he himself toiled among the
first. And they sat in council, grieved, and Agamemnon arose, shedding
tears, like a black-water fountain, which pours its gloomy stream from a
lofty rock. Thus he, deeply sighing, spoke words to the Greeks:</p>
<p>“O friends, leaders and chieftains over the Greeks, Jove, the son of
Saturn, has greatly entangled me in a grievous calamity: cruel, who once
promised me, and assented, that I should return, having destroyed
well-built Ilium. But now has he plotted an evil fraud, and orders me to
return inglorious to Argos, after I have lost much people. Thus,
doubtless, will it be agreeable to almighty Jove, who has already
overthrown the heights of many cities, and will still overthrow them,
for his power is greatest. But come, let us all obey as I advise: let us
fly with the ships to our dear fatherland, for now we shall not take
wide-wayed Troy.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; but they were all still in silence, and the sons of the
Greeks being sad, kept silent long: at length Diomede, brave in the din
of battle, spoke:</p>
<p>“Son of Atreus, thee will I first oppose, speaking inconsiderately, as
is lawful, in the assembly; but be not thou the least offended. First
among the Greeks didst thou disparage my valour, saying that I was
unwarlike and weak;<span id="footnotetag292"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-9.htm.html#footnote292" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">292</sup></a> and all this, as well the young as the old of
the Greeks know. One of two things hath the son of crafty Saturn given
thee: he has granted that thou shouldst be honoured by the sceptre above
all; but valour hath he not given thee, which is the greatest strength.
Strange man, dost thou then certainly think that the sons of the Greeks
are unwarlike and weak, as thou sayest? If indeed thy mind impels thee,
that thou shouldst return, go: the way lies open to thee, and thy ships
stand near the sea, which very many followed thee from Mycenæ. But the
other long-haired Greeks will remain until we overthrow Troy: but if
they also [choose], let them fly with their ships to their dear
fatherland. But we twain, I and Sthenelus,<span id="footnotetag293"/>

find an end of Troy; for under the auspices of the deity we came.”</p>

   præterea nemo sequatur (contra Ariovistum), tamen se cum sola

<p>Thus he spoke; but all the sons of the Greeks applauded, admiring the
speech of steed-breaking Diomede. But them the knight Nestor, rising up,
addressed:</p>
<p>“Son of Tydeus, pre-eminently indeed art thou brave in battle, and the
best in council amongst all thine equals. No one has censured thy
discourse, nor contradicts it, as many as are the Greeks; but thou
comest not to an end of discussion.<span id="footnotetag294"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-9.htm.html#footnote294" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">294</sup></a> Assuredly thou art youthful,
and mightst be my youngest son for age, yet thou speakest prudent words
to the kings of the Greeks, for thou hast said aright. But come, I who
boast to be older than thou, will speak out, and discuss everything: nor
will any one, not even king Agamemnon, disregard my speech. Tribeless,
lawless, homeless is he, who loves horrid civil war. But now, however,
let us obey dark night, and make ready suppers. But let the respective
guards lie down beside the trench, dug without the wall. To the youth,
indeed, I enjoin these things; but next, Atrides, do thou begin, for
thou art supreme. Give a banquet to the elders; it becomes thee, and is
not unseemly. Full are thy tents of wine, which the ships of the Greeks
daily bring over the wide sea from Thrace. Thou hast every
accommodation, and rulest over many people. But when many are assembled,
do thou obey him who shall give the best advice; for there is great need
of good and prudent [advice] to all the Greeks, since the enemy are
burning many fires near the ships; and who can rejoice at these things?
But this night will either ruin the army or preserve it.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote294"/><b>Footnote 294:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-9.htm.html#footnotetag294" class="pginternal">
(return) </a> <i>I. e</i>. thou hast not said all that might have
   been said on the subject.</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; and they heard him very attentively, and obeyed. But the
guards rushed forth with their arms, [those around] Thrasymedes, the son
of Nestor, the shepherd of the people, Ascalaphus and Ialmenus, sons of
Mars, Meriones, Aphareus, and Deïpyrus, as well as the son of Creon,
noble Lycomedes. There were seven leaders of the guards, and a hundred
youths marched along with each, holding long spears in their hands.
Proceeding to the space between the trench and the wall, there they sat
down, and there kindled a fire, and prepared each his supper.</p>
<p>But Atrides conducted the assembled elders of the Greeks to his tent,
and set before them a strength-recruiting banquet; and they laid their
hands upon the viands placed before them. But when they had dismissed
the desire of eating and drinking, to them first of all did aged Nestor,
whose advice had previously appeared best, begin to interweave advice;
who wisely counselling, addressed them, and said:</p>
<p>“Most glorious Atrides, king of men, Agamemnon, with thee shall I end,
and with thee shall I commence. Since thou art a king of many nations,
and Jove hath placed in thine hands both a sceptre and laws, that thou
mayest consult for their advantage. Therefore is it necessary that thou
in particular shouldst deliver and hear an opinion, and also accomplish
that of another, when his mind urges any one to speak for the [public]
good; but on thee will depend whatever takes the lead. Yet will I speak
as appears to me to be best. For no other person will propound a better
opinion than that which I meditate, both of old and also now, from that
period when thou, O nobly born, didst depart, carrying off the maid
Briseïs from the tent of the enraged Achilles; by no means according to
my judgment; for I very strenuously dissuaded thee from it: but having
yielded to thy haughty temper, thou didst dishonour the bravest hero,
whom even the immortals have honoured; for, taking away his reward, thou
still retainest it. Yet even now let us deliberate how we may succeed in
persuading him, appeasing him with agreeable gifts and soothing words.”</p>
<p>But him the king of men, Agamemnon, again addressed: “Old man, thou hast
not falsely enumerated my errors. I have erred, nor do I myself deny it.
That man indeed is equivalent to many troops, whom Jove loves in his
heart, as now he hath honoured this man, and subdued the people of the
Greeks. But since I erred, having yielded to my wayward disposition, I
desire again to appease him, and to give him invaluable presents. Before
you all will I enumerate the distinguished gifts: seven tripods
untouched by fire,<span id="footnotetag295"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-9.htm.html#footnote295" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">295</sup></a> and ten talents of gold, and twenty shining
caldrons, and twelve stout steeds, victorious in the race, which have
borne off prizes by their feet. No pauper would the man be, nor in want
of precious gold, to whom as many prizes belong as [these] solid-hoofed
steeds have brought to me. I will likewise give seven beautiful Lesbian
women, skilful in faultless works; whom I selected when he himself took
well-inhabited Lesbos, who excel the race of women in beauty. These will
I give him, and amongst them will be her whom then I took away, the
daughter of Briseïs; and I will swear moreover a mighty oath, that I
never ascended her bed, nor embraced her, as is the custom of human
beings—of men and women. All these shall immediately be ready; and if,
moreover, the gods grant that we destroy the great city of Priam, let
him fill his ships abundantly with gold and brass, entering in when we
the Greeks divide the spoil. Let him also choose twenty Trojan women,
who may be fairest next to Argive Helen. But if we reach Achæan Argos,
the udder of the land,<span id="footnotetag296"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-9.htm.html#footnote296" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">296</sup></a> he may become my son-in-law; and I will
honour him equally with Orestes, who is nurtured as my darling son, in
great affluence. Now, I have three daughters in my well-built
palace,—Chrysothemis, Laodice, and Iphianassa. Of these let him lead
the beloved one, whichsoever he may choose, without marriage-dower, to
the house of Peleus; but I will give very many dowries, so many as no
man ever yet gave to his daughter. I will, moreover, give him seven
well-inhabited cities,—Cardamyle, Enope, and grassy Ira, glorious
Pheræ, with deep-pastured Anthea, fair Æpeia, and vine-bearing Pedasus;
which are all near the sea, the last towards sandy Pylus. But in them
dwell men rich in flocks and herds, who will honour him like a god with
gifts, and beneath his sceptre will pay rich tributes. These will I
bestow upon him, ceasing from his anger. Let him be prevailed upon.
Pluto indeed is implacable and inexorable, wherefore he is the most
hateful of all the gods to men. Let him likewise yield to me, inasmuch
as I am more kingly, and because I boast to be older [than he].”</p>
<p>But him the Gerenian knight Nestor then answered: “Most glorious son of
Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, thou indeed offerest gifts by no means
despicable to king Achilles. But come, let us urge chosen men, who may
go with all speed to the tent of Achilles, the son of Peleus. Come then,
these will I select, but let them obey. First of all indeed let Phœnix,
dear to Jove, be the leader; next then mighty Ajax and divine Ulysses:
and of the heralds, let Hodius and Eurybates follow with them. But bring
water for the hands, and command to observe well-omened words,<span id="footnotetag297"/>

   the god, might defeat the object of their supplications.” See
   Servius on Virg. Æn. v. 71; Lamb, on Hor. Od. iii. 1, 2;
   Broukhus. on Tibull. ii. 1, 1.</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, and delivered an opinion agreeable to them all.
Immediately indeed the heralds poured water upon their hands, and the
youths crowned the goblets with wine; then they distributed them to all,
having poured the first of the wine into the cups. But when they had
made libations, and drunk as much as their mind desired, they hastened
from the tent of Agamemnon, the son of Atreus. To them the Gerenian
knight Nestor gave many charges, looking wistfully upon each,
particularly upon Ulysses, that they should endeavour to persuade the
blameless son of Peleus.</p>
<p>They twain then went along the shore of the loud-sounding sea, praying
earnestly to earth-shaking [Neptune], who encompasses the earth, that
they might easily persuade the great mind of the grandson of Æacus. But
they came to the tents and ships of the Myrmidons, and they found him
delighting his soul with his clear-toned harp, beautiful, curiously
wrought, and upon it was a silver comb. This he had taken from amongst
the spoils, having destroyed the city of Eëtion, and with it he was
delighting his soul, and singing the glorious deeds<span id="footnotetag298"/>

Patroclus alone sat opposite to him in silence, waiting upon the
descendant of Æacus when he should cease to sing. Then they advanced
farther, and divine Ulysses preceded; and they stood before him; whilst
Achilles, astonished, leaped up, with his lyre, quitting the seat where
he had been sitting. In like manner Patroclus, when he beheld the
heroes, arose, and swift-footed Achilles taking them by the hand,
addressed them:</p>
<p>“Hail, warriors, ye indeed have come as friends. Surely [there is] some
great necessity [when ye come], who are to me, although enraged, dearest
of the Greeks.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote298"/><b>Footnote 298:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-9.htm.html#footnotetag298" class="pginternal">

<p>Thus having spoken, divine Achilles led them forward, and seated them
upon couches and purple coverlets; then straightway he addressed
Patroclus, who was near:</p>
<p>“Place a larger goblet, O son of Menœtius, mix purer wine,<span id="footnotetag299"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-9.htm.html#footnote299" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">299</sup></a> and

   picture of ancient manners, compared with the customs of the
   Hebrew fathers, compare Coleridge, p. 151.</p>
<p>Thus he spoke; and Patroclus obeyed his dear companion. But he
[Achilles] placed in the flame of the fire a large dressing-block, and
upon it he laid the chine of a sheep and of a fat goat, with the back of
a fatted sow, abounding in fat. Automedon then held them for him, and
noble Achilles cut them up; and divided them skilfully into small
pieces, and transfixed them with spits; whilst the son of Menœtius, a
godlike hero, kindled a large fire. But when the fire had burned away,
and the flame grew languid, strewing the embers, he extended the spits
over them, and sprinkled them with sacred salt, raising them up from the
racks. But when he had dressed them, and had thrown them upon kitchen
tables, Patroclus, taking bread, served it out upon the board in
beautiful baskets: but Achilles distributed the flesh. But he himself
sat opposite to noble Ulysses, against the other wall, and ordered
Patroclus, his companion, to sacrifice to the gods; and he accordingly
cast the first morsels<span id="footnotetag300"/>

their hands to the prepared viands which lay before them. But when they
had dismissed the desire of eating and drinking, Ajax nodded to Phoenix,
but noble Ulysses observed it, and having filled his goblet with wine,
he pledged Achilles:</p>
<p class="footnote"><span id="footnote300"/><b>Footnote 300:</b><a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-9.htm.html#footnotetag300" class="pginternal">

<p>“Health, Achilles. We are not wanting of a complete feast, either in the
tent of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, or even here also, for many
strength-recruiting dainties are here; but the business of an agreeable
feast is not our care. We, O thou Jove-nurtured one, contemplating it,
rather dread a very great disaster, as it is matter of doubt whether the
well-benched ships be saved or destroyed, unless thou puttest on thy
might. For near the ships and the wall the high-minded Trojans and their
far-summoned allies have pitched their camp, kindling many fires
throughout the host; and they say that they will no longer restrain
themselves, but that they will fall upon our black vessels.<span id="footnotetag301"/>

Saturnian Jove exhibiting to them propitious signs, darts his lightning;
and Hector, looking fiercely round in valour, rages terribly, trusting
in Jove, nor reverences at all either men or gods, but great madness
hath come upon him. He prays that divine morn may speedily come. For he
declares that he will cut off the poop-ends<span id="footnotetag302"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-9.htm.html#footnote302" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">302</sup></a> of the ships, and burn
[the ships] themselves with ravaging fire, and slaughter the Greeks
beside them, discomforted by the smoke. Wherefore do I greatly fear in
my mind lest the gods may fulfil his threats, and it be destined for us
to perish in Troy, far from steed-nourishing Argos. Rise then, if thou
hast the intention, although late, to defend the harassed sons of the
Greeks from the violent onslaught of the Trojans. To thyself it will
hereafter be a cause of sorrow, nor is it possible in any manner to
discover a remedy for a disaster when received; wherefore reflect much
beforehand, how thou mayest avert the evil day from the Greeks. O my
friend, surely thy father Peleus charged thee, on that day when he sent
thee from Phthia to Agamemnon, ‘My son, Minerva and Juno will bestow
valour, if they choose; but restrain thy great-hearted soul within thy
breast, because humanity is better; and abstain from injurious
contention, that both the youth and elders of the Greeks may honour thee
the more.’ Thus did the old man give charge, but thou art forgetful. Yet
even now desist, and lay aside thy mind-corroding wrath. To thee
Agamemnon gives worthy gifts, ceasing from indignation. But if [thou
wilt] hear from me, and I will repeat to thee how many presents
Agamemnon in his tents hath promised thee: seven tripods, untouched by
the fire, and ten talents of gold, twenty shining caldrons, and twelve
stout steeds, victorious in the race, which have borne off prizes by
their feet. No pauper, nor in want of precious gold, would that man be
to whom so many prizes belonged as the steeds of Agamemnon have borne
off by their fleetness. He will likewise give seven beautiful women,
skilful in faultless works, Lesbians, whom he selected when thou thyself
didst take well-inhabited Lesbos, who then excelled the race of women in
beauty. These will he give thee, and amongst them will be her whom once
he took away, the daughter of Briseïs; and he will moreover swear a
mighty oath, that he never ascended her bed, nor embraced her, as is the
custom. O king, both of men and women. All these shall immediately be in
waiting; and if, moreover, the gods grant that we pillage the vast city
of Priam, entering, thou mayest fill thy ships abundantly with gold and
brass, when we, the Greeks, divide the spoil. Thou shalt also choose
twenty Trojan women, who may be fairest next to Argive Helen. But if we
reach Achæan Argos, the udder of the land, thou mayest become his
son-in-law, and he will honour thee equally with Orestes, who is
nurtured as his darling son, in great affluence. But he has three
daughters in his well-built palace,—Chrysothemis, Laodice, and
Iphianassa. Of these thou shalt conduct the most beloved whomsoever thou
mayest choose, without marriage-gifts, to the house of Peleus; but he
will give very many dowries, such as no man yet gave his daughter. He
will moreover give thee seven well-inhabited cities,—Cardamyle, Enope,
and grassy Ira, glorious Pheræ, with deep-pastured Anthea, fair Æpeia,
and vine-bearing Pedasus; which are all near the sea, the last towards
sandy Pylus. But in them dwell men abounding in flocks and herds, who
will honour thee with gifts like a god, and under thy sceptre pay rich
tributes. These will he fulfil to thee ceasing from thy wrath. But if
indeed the son of Atreus himself and his gifts be more hateful to thee
from thine heart, at least have pity upon all the other Greeks, harassed
throughout the army, who will honour thee as a god; for surely thou wilt
obtain very great honour among them. For now mayest thou slay Hector,
since he hath already come very near thee, possessing destructive fury;
since he declares that no one of the Greeks whom the ships have conveyed
hither is his equal.”</p>

all these have I carried off many and precious spoils, and bearing them,
have given all to Agamemnon, the son of Atreus; whilst he, remaining
behind at the swift ships, receiving them, hath distributed but few, but
retained many. To the chiefs and kings hath he given other prizes; to
whom indeed they remain entire: but from me alone of the Greeks hath he
taken it away, and he possesses my spouse, dear to my soul, with whom
reclining, let him delight himself. But why is it necessary that the
Greeks wage war with the Trojans? Or from what necessity did the son of
Atreus, assembling an army, lead it hither? Was it not on account of
fair-haired Helen? Do the sons of Atreus alone, of articulate-speaking
men, love their wives? [Surely not], since whatever man is good and
prudent loves and cherishes his spouse; thus I too loved her from my
soul, though the captive of my spear. And now since he hath snatched my
reward from my hands, and deceived me, let him not make trial of me,
already well informed, for he will not persuade me; but let him consider
with thee, O Ulysses, and the other kings, how he may repel the hostile
fire from the ships. Assuredly he has already accomplished many labours
without me. He has already built a rampart, and drawn a trench broad
[and] large beside it; and planted in it palisades; but not even thus
can he restrain the might of man-slaughtering Hector. Whilst I indeed
fought amongst the Greeks, Hector chose not to arouse the battle at a
distance from the wall, but he came [only] as far as the Scæan gates,
and the beech-tree. There once he awaited me alone, and with difficulty
escaped my attack. But since I choose not to war with noble Hector,

will Peleus himself hereafter bestow upon me a lady in marriage. There

chieftains who defend the cities. Whomsoever of these I may choose, I
will make my beloved wife; and there my generous soul very much desires
that I, wedding a betrothed spouse, a fit partner of my bed, should
enjoy the possessions which aged Peleus hath acquired. For not worth my

the people have taken courage. But do ye, departing, bear back this
message to the chiefs of the Greeks, for such is the office of
ambassadors, that they devise within their minds some other better plan,
which for them may preserve their ships, and the army of the Greeks in
the hollow barks; since this, which they have now devised, is not

<p>Thus he spoke; but they all became mute in silence, marvelling at his
speech, for he answered with much vehemence. At length, however, the
aged knight, Phœnix, addressed him, shedding tears, for he greatly
feared for the ships of the Greeks:</p>
<p>“If indeed, Ο illustrious Achilles, thou dost now meditate a return
within thy mind, nor art at all willing to repel the destructive fire
from the swift ships, because indignation hath fallen upon thy soul; how
then can I, my dear child, be left here alone by thee? for aged Peleus,
the breaker of steeds, sent me forth with thee on that day, when he
despatched thee from Phthia to Agamemnon, a boy, not yet skilled either
in equally-destroying war, nor in counsels where men also become
illustrious. On which account he sent me forth to teach thee all these
things, that thou mightest become both an orator in words and a
performer in deeds. Thus then, my dear child, I wish not at length to be
left by thee, not even if a god himself, having divested me of old age,
should promise that he would render me a blooming youth, such as I was
when first I quitted fair-damed Hellas, flying the contentions of my
father Amyntor, son of Ormenus; who was enraged with me on account of a
fair-haired concubine whom he himself loved, but dishonoured his wife,
my mother. But she continually would embrace my knees in supplication,
that I should first have connection with the concubine, that she might
loathe the old man. Her I obeyed, and did so; but my father immediately
perceiving it, uttered many execrations, and invoked the hateful
Erinnys, that no dear son, sprung from me, should ever be placed upon
his knees; and the gods ratified his execrations, both infernal Jove and
dread Proserpine. Then my soul within my mind could no longer endure
that I should sojourn in the palace whilst my father was enraged. My
friends, indeed, and relations, being much about me, detained me there
within the halls, entreating [me to stay]. Many fat sheep and
stamping-footed, crooked-horned oxen they slaughtered; many swine
abounding in fat were stretched out to be roasted in the flame of
Vulcan, and much of the old man’s wine was drunk out of earthen vessels.
Nine nights did they sleep around me: whilst, taking it in turns, they
kept watch; nor was the fire ever extinguished, one in the portico of
the well-fenced hall, and another in the vestibule, before the
chamber-doors. But when at length the tenth shady night had come upon
me, then indeed I rushed forth, having burst the skilfully-joined doors
of the apartment, and I easily overleaped the fence of the hall,
escaping the notice of the watchmen and the female domestics. Afterwards
I fled thence through spacious Hellas, and came to fertile Phthia, the
mother of sheep, to king Peleus; who kindly received me, and loved me
even as a father loves his only son, born in his old age<span id="footnotetag314"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-9.htm.html#footnote314" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">314</sup></a> to ample
possessions. He made me opulent, and bestowed upon me much people, and I
inhabited the extreme shores of Phthia, ruling over the Dolopians. Thee
too, Ο godlike Achilles, have I rendered what thou art,<span id="footnotetag315"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-9.htm.html#footnote315" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">315</sup></a> loving thee
from my soul; since thou wouldst not go with another to the feast, nor
take food in the mansion, until I, placing thee upon my knees, satisfied
thee with viands, previously carving them, and supplied thee with wine.
Often hast thou wetted the tunic upon my breast, ejecting the wine in
infant peevishness.<span id="footnotetag316"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-9.htm.html#footnote316" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">316</sup></a> Thus have I borne very many things from thee,
and much have I laboured, thinking this, that since the gods have not
granted an offspring to me from myself, I should at least make thee my
son, O Achilles, like unto the gods, that thou mightst yet repel from me
unworthy destiny. But O Achilles, subdue thy mighty rage; it is by no
means necessary for thee to have a merciless heart. Flexible are even
the gods themselves, whose virtue, honour, and might are greater [than
thine]. Even these, when any one transgresses and errs, do men divert
[from their wrath] by sacrifices and appeasing vows, and frankincense
and savour. For Prayers also are the daughters of supreme Jove,<span id="footnotetag317"/>

both halt, and wrinkled, and squint-eyed; which following on Ate from
behind, are full of care. But Ate is robust and sound in limb, wherefore
she far outstrips all, and arrives first at every land, doing injury to
men; whilst these afterwards cure them.<span id="footnotetag318"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-9.htm.html#footnote318" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">318</sup></a> Whosoever will reverence
the daughters of Jove approaching, him they are wont greatly to aid, and
hear when praying. But whosoever will deny and obstinately refuse them,
then indeed, drawing near, they entreat Saturnian Jove, that Ate may
follow along with him, that being injured [in turn], he may pay the
penalty. But Ο Achilles, do thou too yield honour to accompany the
daughters of Jove, which bends the minds of other brave men; for if
Atrides brought not gifts, and did not mention others in futurity, but
would ever rage vehemently, I for my part would not advise that, casting
away wrath, thou shouldst defend the Greeks, although greatly in need.
But now he at once gives both many immediately, and promises others
hereafter; moreover, he hath despatched the best men to supplicate thee,
having selected throughout the Grecian army those who are dearest to
thyself; whose entreaty do not thou despise, nor their mission, although
formerly fault was not to be found with thee, because thou wert enraged.
Thus also have we heard the renown of heroes of former days, when
vehement wrath came upon any, [that] they were both appeasable by gifts,
and to be reconciled by words. I remember this ancient and by no means
modern deed, of what sort it was; and I will repeat it among you all,
being friends. The Curetes and Ætolians, obstinate in battle, fought
around the city of Calydon, and slaughtered each other; the Ætolians, in
defence of lofty Calydon, the Curetes, eager to lay it waste in war; for
between them had golden-throned Diana excited mischief, indignant
because Œneus had not offered the first-fruits in sacrifice in the
fertile spot of ground:<span id="footnotetag319"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-9.htm.html#footnote319" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">319</sup></a> whilst the other gods feasted on hecatombs,
but to the daughter of mighty Jove alone he sacrificed not. Either he
forgot,<span id="footnotetag320"/>

she, the daughter of Jove, delighting in arrows, enraged, sent against
[him] a sylvan wild boar, with white tusks, which did much detriment, as
is the wont [of boars], to the land of Œneus. And many tall trees, one
after another, did he prostrate on the ground, with their very roots and
the blossom of their fruit. But him Meleager, son of Œneus, slew,
assembling huntsmen and dogs from many cities; for he would not have
been subdued by a few mortals: so mighty was he, and he caused many to
ascend the sad funeral-pile. Still she (Diana) excited around him<span id="footnotetag321"/>

fought, so long were the Curetes unsuccessful; nor were they able,
although numerous, to remain without the wall. But when wrath, which
swells the minds of others, though very prudent, within their breasts,
came upon Meleager, for, enraged at heart with his dear mother Althæa,
he remained inactive beside his wedded wife, fair Cleopatra, daughter of
Marpessa, the handsome-footed child of Evenus and Idas, who was then the
bravest of earthly men, and even lifted a bow against king Phœbus
Apollo, for the sake of his fair-ankled spouse. Her [Cleopatra] then her
father and venerable mother in the palace were accustomed to call by the

with her hands did she strike the fruitful earth, calling upon Pluto and

immediately was there noise and tumult of these<span id="footnotetag326"/>

gates, the towers being battered. Then did the elders of the Ætolians
entreat him, and sent chosen priests to the gods, that he would come
forth and defend them, promising a great gift. Where the soil of fertile
Calydon was richest, there they ordered him to choose a beautiful
enclosure of fifty acres; the one half, of land fit for vines, to cut
off the other half of plain land, free from wood, for tillage. Much did
aged Œneus, breaker of steeds, beseech him, having ascended to the
threshold of his lofty-roofed chamber, shaking the well-glued door-post,
supplicating his son. And much also his sisters and venerable mother
entreated him, but he the more refused; and much [prayed] the companions
who were dearest and most friendly of all; but not even thus did they
persuade the soul within his breast, until his chamber was violently
assailed, and the Curetes were in the act of scaling the ramparts, and
firing the great city. Then indeed at length his fair-girdled spouse,
weeping, supplicated Meleager, and recounted all the disasters, as many
as happen to men whose city may be taken. In the first place, they slay
the men,<span id="footnotetag327"/>

off the children and deep-zoned women. Then was his soul disturbed when
he heard of evil deeds, and he hasted to go and gird the all-glittering
armour around his body. Thus he repelled the evil day from the Ætolians,
yielding to his own inclination; but they did not make good to him the
many and pleasing gifts; but he nevertheless warded off evil. But
revolve not such things within thy mind, O my friend, nor let the
deity<span id="footnotetag328"/>

assist the ships [when already] set on fire. Rather come for the gifts,
for the Greeks will honour thee equally with a god. If again without
gifts thou enter the man-destroying battle, thou wilt not receive equal
honour, although warding off the war.”</p>
<p>But him swift-footed Achilles, answering, addressed: “Phœnix, respected
father, old man, Jove-nurtured, to me there is no need of this honour,
for I conceive that I have been honoured by the behest of Jove, which
will detain me at the crooked ships whilst breath remains in my bosom,
and my knees have the power of motion. But I will tell thee something
else, and do thou revolve it in thy mind. Disturb not my soul, weeping
and lamenting, gratifying the hero Atrides; it is not at all necessary
that thou love him, that thou mayest not be hated by me, who love thee.

<p>He said, and in silence nodded to Patroclus from beneath his brows, that
he should strew a thick bed for Phœnix, whilst they were meditating to
withdraw as quickly as possible from the tent. But them godlike
Telamonian Ajax addressed:</p>
<p>“O Jove-born son of Laertes, crafty Ulysses, let us go, for the object
of our address appears not to me to be attainable, in this way at least,
and we must report the message to the Greeks with all haste, although it
be not good. They now sit expecting us; but Achilles stores up within
his breast a fierce and haughty soul, unyielding; nor does he regard the
friendship of his companions, with which we have honoured him at the
ships beyond others. Merciless one! and truly some one hath accepted
compensation even for a brother’s death, or his own son slain, whilst
[the murderer] remains at home among his people, having paid many
expiations: and the mind and noble soul of the other is appeased upon
his having received compensation. But in thy breast the gods have put an
unyielding and evil mind, for the sake of a maid only; whereas we now
offer thee seven far excelling, and many other gifts beside them. Do
thou then assume a propitious disposition; and have respect to thy
house, for we are guests beneath thy roof from the multitude of the
Greeks, and desire to be most dear and friendly to thee beyond all the
Achæans, as many as they are.”</p>
<p>But him swift-footed Achilles, answering, addressed: “Most noble Ajax,
son of Telamon, chief of the people, thou appearest to me to have said
all this from thy soul, yet does my heart swell with indignation as
often as I recollect those things, how the son of Atreus hath rendered
me dishonoured among the Greeks, as if it were some contemptible
stranger. But go ye, and carry back my message, for I shall not think of
bloody war, before the son of warlike Priam, noble Hector, slaughtering
the Greeks, shall reach the ships of the Myrmidons, and burn the ships
with fire. But about my tent and black ship, however, I think that
Hector, although eager, will desist from combat.”</p>
<p>Thus he spake; but they, each having seized a double goblet, having made
libations, went back by the side of the fleet, and Ulysses led the way.
But Patroclus gave orders to his companions and female domestics to
strew, with all haste, a thick couch for Phœnix; and they, obedient,
spread a bed as he desired,—sheep-skins, coverlets, and the fine fabric
of flax: there lay the old man, and awaited heavenly Morn. But Achilles
slept in the recess of his well-made tent; and beside him lay a lady,
fair-cheeked Diomede, daughter of Phorbas, whom he had brought from
Lesbos. And Patroclus on the other side reclined: and by him also lay
fair-waisted Iphis, whom noble Achilles gave him, having taken lofty
Scyros, a city of Enyeus.</p>
<p>But when they were within the tents of Atrides, the sons of the Greeks,
rising one after another, received them with golden cups, and
interrogated thus. And first the king of men, Agamemnon, inquired:</p>
<p>“Come, tell me, O Ulysses, much praised, great glory of the Greeks,
whether does he wish to ward off the hostile fire from the ships, or has
he refused, and does wrath still posses his haughty soul?”</p>
<p>But him much-enduring, noble Ulysses then addressed: “Most glorious son
of Atreus, Agamemnon, king of men, he wills not to extinguish his wrath,
but is the more filled with anger, and despises thee as well as thy
gifts. He bids thee thyself consult with the Greeks, in what manner thou
mayest preserve both the ships and the army of the Greeks, but has
himself threatened, that with the rising dawn he will launch into the
main his well-benched, equally-plied vessels. And he has declared that
he would advise others also to sail home, since ye will not now effect
the destruction of lofty Ilium; for far-resounding Jove hath greatly
stretched forth his hand [over it], and the people have taken courage.
Thus he spoke; and here are these who followed me, Ajax, and the two
heralds, both prudent men, to tell these things. But aged Phœnix hath
lain down there, for thus he ordered, that in the morning, if he chose,
he might follow him in the ships to his dear father-land; but he will by
no means carry him off against his will.”</p>
<p>Thus he spake; and they all became mute in silence, marvelling at his
speech, for he harangued with great vehemence. Long were the sorrowing
sons of the Greeks mute, till at length Diomede, valiant in the din of
battle, addressed them:</p>
<p>“Most glorious son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, would that thou
hadst not supplicated the illustrious son of Peleus, offering countless
gifts, for he is haughty even otherwise:<span id="footnotetag330"/>
<a href="8993743519344158754_22382-h-9.htm.html#footnote330" class="pginternal"><sup class="sml">330</sup></a> now again hast thou
excited him much more to insolence. Let us, however, leave him alone,
whether he go or remain, for he will fight again at that time when his
mind within his breast urges, and the Deity incites him. But come, let
us all obey as I shall advise: go now to rest, having satisfied your
hearts with food and wine, for this is force and vigour. But when fair
rosy-fingered morn has shone forth, draw up the infantry and cavalry
with all haste before the ships, cheering them: and do thou thyself
likewise fight in the foremost ranks.”</p>
<p>Thus he spake, but all the kings approved, admiring the speech of
Diomede, the breaker of steeds. Having then offered libations, they
departed each to his tent; there they lay down to to rest, and enjoyed the
boon of sleep.<span id="footnotetag331"/>
