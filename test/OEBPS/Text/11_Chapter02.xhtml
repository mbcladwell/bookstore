<p class="CN">CHAPTER 2</p>
<p class="CT"><span class="line">THE BIRTH OF A MONSTER</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">On July 6, 2019, federal agents swarmed a private jet at New Jersey’s private Teterboro airport.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">As an unsuspecting Jeffrey Epstein walked off the plane, he was apprehended, handcuffed and placed under arrest—for sex trafficking.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">The events of that day not only shocked the convicted pedophile, a man who had long evaded justice but also, stunned the world, a world that had thought his reign of lawless horrors would continue forever.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">As Epstein descended through the clouds to his ultimate destiny, he surely had no idea what awaited him on the tarmac.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">In those final last moments of blissful ignorance, he would have passed over the very place where it all began. Looking from the windows of his plush private jet, once known as the “Lolita Express,” Epstein could have looked down upon the tidy streets and neatly appointed homes of Sea Gate, Brooklyn, the quaint middle-class neighborhood in which he was raised.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">As he walked those streets decades before, no one ever could have expected what was to come: how high he would rise, how far he would fall, and how thoroughly his life, his reputation, and his circumstances would change.</p>
<p class="starimage"><img alt="image" src="../Images/star.jpg" width="5%"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Born on January 20, 1953, Jeffrey Epstein was the cherished first child of school aide Pauline and gardener Seymour.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">On the day of his birth, Dwight D. Eisenhower was sworn in as the thirty-fourth president President of the United States, and shared an ominous warning in his inauguration address: “We sense with all our faculties that forces of good and evil are massed and armed and opposed as rarely before in history.” How little did he know.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Epstein’s parents had married only months earlier, when Pauline was already pregnant with Jeffrey. Both were children of Jewish European immigrants, and many of their family members had been killed in the Holocaust. Nothing in their background could have hinted at the hellish crimes their son would commit.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">A year after Jeffrey’s birth, his younger brother Mark was born. The two boys were raised in the quiet enclave of Sea Gate.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Epstein’s childhood friend Gary Grossberg spoke exclusively to reporter Andy Tillett about his quiet young life with his charming friend, Jeff—and the surprising way his friend’s life has turned out.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“Sea Gate was a very, very beautiful, happy family community,” Grossberg began. “If you go out to Sea Gate, Coney Island was there, and it was just very, very private. The beach was there, the ocean was there. It was very, very charming, very charming.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">He continued:</p>
<p class="paraNoIndentE">It was great. It was wonderful. The Epsteins are just lovely, lovely people. Absolutely the best. No doubt about it. No doubt in my mind. His mother, just the most wonderful woman. In fact, you know something? When I speak to you, I speak to you with his mother’s heart. Okay?</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">You’ve got to remember this was in the seventies, and life was very different. There was no Internet. There was no high-profile cable TV. There was no media. There was no nonsense. . . .</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">I was actually close with Mark, his brother, but Jeff was a friend.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">We didn’t share a lot of time because he was a year older than us, and he was in a different grade. And due to his magnetic personality and well-being, he was in different circles. . . .</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">He was always a gentleman, always very kind with everyone. And he did a lot of things for a lot of people. . . .</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">Always did things right. The Epsteins, they’re like that. They’re good, kind people, whether it’s in education, philanthropy, the facilitation of people. They were around people who were doing these types of things.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">People are not talking about that. They’re only talking about the individuals who were so-called around him. So it’s just unfortunate that this particular situation came down and turned into a cancer.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">Jeffrey’s a very good-looking guy, number one. Very, very talented. He’s got money and people, women. They became jealous, whatever it may be. And so I don’t believe all these stories about all this nonsense. I’m not saying that there were no improprieties, because who knows, I wasn’t there. But I can only tell you about the caliber of the individual that people are talking about. . . .</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">I only knew and know of the Epsteins in a very, very wonderful way, and it’s important for people to speak the truth. And as I say, I don’t believe any of these stories about any of that stuff going on because I don’t know him that way. I’m telling you the truth. And I’m not trying to hide anything. I’m letting you know exactly. I don’t believe it.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">I truly believe that this was politically motivated. I guarantee you that he would have never been arrested if Alex Acosta was not on Trump’s cabinet. If he wasn’t connected, if there was no election, if there was nothing happening . . . it’s shit. Everything had happened. It’s very sad.”</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Like most children in the neighborhood, Epstein attended local public schools with Grossberg, later entering the Lafayette High School in South-Central Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Already making his mark, Epstein skipped his freshman and sophomore years, and joined the math team, where he competed with Brenda Solovitz. In an exclusive interview with our team, Solovitz said Epstein still seemed like a normal guy in high school, too.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndentE">At that time, he seemed to be just like a normal person. I don’t know of him doing anything outrageous. He was no worse and no different to the rest of us at that point.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">“He probably came to my house as part of the math team. Sometimes I made a lasagna and they’d all come over for lunch, but that was it really.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">I don’t know what he did, but he seemed normal to us. There was nothing about his behavior that seemed off.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">He was really bright, and he was in the honors classes I was in, and certainly we moved in the same classes. He seemed fine, just seemed normal, y’know? He wasn’t standoffish from people. He was funny sometimes. He fit right in. He didn’t seem like a geek. To me, he seemed like a normal person.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">His father worked in the parks department and that wasn’t unusual at that time. A lot of us came from lower middle—what used to be middle class, but we lived in housing projects and things like that. It was just our fathers’ luck, but we didn’t have a lot of money.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">To me he was a normal guy, a really bright normal guy.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">From there, though, Epstein’s path would grow rockier as his dark side began to emerge. In 1969, sixteen-year-old Epstein graduated from high school two years early and entered the prestigious Cooper Union college in lower Manhattan. At Cooper Union, he took advanced math classes and made extra cash by tutoring classmates. But suddenly and inexplicably, he dropped out in spring 1971.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Just a few months later, Epstein enrolled instead at New York University’s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, where he studied the mathematical aspects of heart physiology. But in June 1974—when the go-go 1960s had given way to the gas lines and financial downturn of the 1970s—Epstein again quit school, having failed to receive a degree from either institution.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">It remains something of a mystery as to why he dropped out of both institutions. Still, the decision to end his academic career would not slow ambitious Epstein’s rise through Manhattan’s elite.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">That fall, the twenty-one-year-old college dropout was hired to teach math and physics at the Dalton School, one of Manhattan’s most prestigious private schools. Located on the ritzy Upper East Side, Dalton then cost roughly $3,000 a year to attend—more than $15,000 in modern currency. Today, the annual tuition has ballooned to more than $50,000.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">When Epstein arrived, the school was filled with rich kids from the upper echelon that he was desperate to enter. Soon-to-be celebrity students who attended Dalton while Epstein was a teacher included <span class="italic">Dirty Dancing</span> star Jennifer Grey, Maggie Wheeler (Janice from <span class="italic">Friends</span>), media mogul Rupert Murdoch’s daughter Prudence, and Michael J. Fox’s future wife Tracy Pollan, who starred in the 1980s sitcom <span class="italic">Family Ties</span>.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">In an unusual twist of fate, Epstein was hired at the prestigious institution only months after authoritarian headmaster Donald Barr had stepped down. Barr was the father of current US Attorney General William Barr, the man who would later be responsible for prosecuting Epstein, in 2019.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">As headmaster, the elder Barr had turned the notoriously progressive school into a punishingly conservative institution. Girls were sent home for wearing short skirts; boys, for having long hair. Teachers were forbidden from wearing casual or eccentric clothes, the colors and cuts that had been fashionable just a few years before. And if students were busted for smoking weed, they could only avoid expulsion by undergoing therapy. Barr was the Dalton dictator, and he considered his orders “ukases”—an Imperial Russian term for edicts made by a czar.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“They think they can cheat on tests, steal from one another’s lockers and exploit each other emotionally so long as they have the right opinions about the war or civil rights or something else,” Barr said at the time. “That is not morality.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Halfway through the 1974 school year, the conservative headmaster clashed with the Dalton board of trustees and resigned in protest. His replacement, Dr. Gardner Dunnan, rolled back some of the stricter codes of conduct, giving Epstein—a predator in the making—the perfect hunting ground.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">With no outdoor hangout areas, students socialized in the hallways, and Epstein frequently inserted himself into these groups. At the time, most students viewed him as a quirky young teacher who cared more about gossiping than grading.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“I won’t say that the girls didn’t like him, but they thought he was odd,” former Dalton alumna Karin Williams said of the young teacher. “You noticed him. He stood out as this young guy in this weird coat.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">(Williams is referring to the full-length fur coat Epstein wore to school, the kind favored by the men who lorded over the streetwalkers off Times Square, or who waited at Penn Station to swoop in on fresh-faced new arrivals to the city.)</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Under that coat, Epstein kept the top two buttons of his shirt open, exposing a gold chain necklace. Most girls didn’t take him seriously, and perhaps that was precisely how Epstein wanted them to think of him: laid-back and approachable.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“I was a 14-year-old and he helped me through a time when there wasn’t anybody else to talk to,” Dalton graduate Leslie Kitziger told the <span class="italic">New York Times</span> in a 2019 exposé on Epstein’s Dalton years. “He listened . . . I felt like he really cared that I was having a rough go.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Former student Scott Spizer even remembered Epstein popping up at a boozy student party, and recalled the special attention he gave to the girls.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“I can remember thinking at the time, ‘This is wrong,’” Spizer told the <span class="italic">Times</span>. “He was much more present amongst the students, specifically the girl students, during non-teaching hours. . . . It was kind of inappropriate.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">What’s more, Dalton alumnus Mark Robinson claimed that Epstein wasn’t the only faculty member cruising the halls for sexual conquests.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“There were a number of teachers who looked at the student body as their next meal,” Robinson alleged.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">But Epstein didn’t get far. Amid complaints about his lackadaisical teaching style, the Dalton school board terminated Epstein after the 1976 school year.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“It was determined that he had not adequately grown as a new teacher to the standard of the school,” said Peter Branch, head of the high school at the time. Branch only recalled getting complaints about Epstein’s poor academic abilities, though—not his personal habits.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">True to form, Epstein somehow managed to turn that failure into a stepping-stone to even greater success: a job on Wall Street.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">During a parent-teacher conference, the twenty-three-year-old had managed to dazzle one student’s financier father. So, when Epstein was fired from Dalton, the broker connected Epstein with Alan Greenberg, a Wall Street bigwig who was poised to become chief executive officer of multibillion-dollar global investment bank and brokerage firm Bear Stearns.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“This parent was so wowed by the conversation he told my father, ‘You’ve got to hire this guy,’” Greenberg’s daughter Lynne Koeppel recalled to the <span class="italic">Miami Herald</span>. “That was Jeff. He was very smart and he knew how to woo people, how to schmooze . . . If that was his plan, it worked.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Later that year, Epstein landed a job at Bear Stearns as a low-level junior assistant to a floor trader. He swiftly rose through the ranks, and within four years he had become a limited partner, taking on mega-millionaire clients like Seagram president Edgar Bronfman. For Epstein, it was a boyhood dream come true. But it wouldn’t last.</p>
