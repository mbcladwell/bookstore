<p class="CN">CHAPTER 13</p>
<p class="CT"><span class="line">CAUGHT</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">By early 2019, it seemed that the world had forgotten about Jeffrey Epstein and his crimes. To him, it may have seemed—at last—that he’d gotten away with it all.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">The civil cases in Florida were moving slowly through the justice system. In December 2018, he paid to settle a lawsuit with victim attorney Bradley Edwards, preventing any trial and silencing his victims yet again. Several women had been ready to take the stand, but they were pushed yet again into the shadows of silence.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">More than ten years after Jane Does #1 and 2 had filed their lawsuit against the US government regarding Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement, that too had yet to bear legal any fruit. But by February 2019, that all changed.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">On February 7, 2019, the Department of Justice confirmed that they had begun an investigation into whether there had been “professional misconduct” in the unusual handling of Epstein’s secret plea deal.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Two weeks later, US District Judge Kenneth A. Marra ruled in favor of Jane Does #1 and 2 in Florida, agreeing that the United States government had indeed broken the law during their handling of the nonprosecution agreement.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“Particularly problematic was the government’s decision to conceal the existence of the [nonprosecution agreement] and mislead the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility,” Marra wrote, referring to one communication that told the plaintiffs to remain “patient.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“When the government gives information to victims, it cannot be misleading.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">He continued:</p>
<p class="paraNoIndentE">Epstein and his co-conspirators knowingly traveled in interstate and international commerce to sexually abuse Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2 and others, they committed violations of not only Florida law, but also federal law.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">In addition to his own sexual abuse of the victims, Epstein directed other persons to abuse the girls sexually. . . . Epstein worked in concert with others to obtain minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The net was closing in.</p>
<p class="starimage"><img alt="image" src="../Images/star.jpg" width="5%"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Flying on a private jet from Paris, landing at a private airport, skipping the baggage claim to head straight to the luxury ride awaiting—it was the only way to travel for someone of Jeffrey Epstein’s milieu. For Jeffrey Epstein, July 6, 2019, had promised to be yet another serene and sumptuous evening in the life of a billionaire.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">As the plane taxied down the tarmac, however, the sun setting on the horizon, he likely realized that there was going to be a change of plans. Epstein’s bubble of wealth and privilege was popped, perhaps once and for all. Federal agents stood ready on the tarmac, swooping in to handcuff and arrest him as soon as he walked off the infamous “Lolita Express” for the very last time.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">At the same time, federal agents swarmed his Manhattan palace, ready to open every drawer and search the rooms where visitors had never set foot. A crowbar got them through his massive solid oak front doors, as onlookers watched, shocked.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">To no one’s surprise, authorities found ample evidence to confirm that Epstein was trafficking girls for sex. In his safe, they discovered hundreds of sickening nude pictures of young victims, and the graphic photographs matched the most disturbing details that Epstein’s victims had provided.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">He also had curated an organized library of digital videos that identified the names of his “friends” and the young girls they had violated. Federal agents seized all of it. They also recovered heaps of cash and diamonds, and a fake expired passport with Epstein’s picture plastered inside. It listed his residence as Saudi Arabia. (In court, Epstein’s lawyers argued that he’d never used the phony passport, but the document itself indicated that it’d been used to get into the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Saudi Arabia. Epstein’s attorneys said in a filing submitted to court that he obtained the passport because he felt it could give him some protection if he fell victim to an airline hijacking or a terrorist incident, and that it’d been expired for more than three decades.)</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Importantly, the trove of evidence was not just proof of Epstein’s sex crimes; the materials also corroborated the victims’ claims that Epstein secretly recorded them in the act. Epstein and his coconspirators seemed poised for certain doom, as a copy of the voluminous evidence list was turned over to US District Judge Richard Berman.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Two days later, the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York hosted a joint press conference with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Entering the room, reporters were greeted with a massive blown-up photo of Epstein, and a phone number imploring potential victims to call the authorities.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Manhattan US Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman—an appointee of President Donald J. Trump—approached the podium to deliver the jaw-dropping news: <span class="italic">Jeffrey Epstein had been indicted for sex trafficking</span>. It was a day that had seemed like it would never come. For those of us who’d covered the case for years, and certainly for the victims, it had a surreal quality. Did we dare hope for justice this time around?</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Berman began to speak:</p>
<p class="paraNoIndentE">Today, we announce the unsealing of sex trafficking charges against Jeffrey Epstein. The charges allege that Epstein sexually abused young girls by enticing them to engage in sex acts for money.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">Epstein was arrested this past Saturday evening at Teterboro Airport aboard his private jet that had just landed from Paris, France. Epstein was taken to the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">And later today he will be presented before a Magistrate Judge Pitman and later a conference before District Court Judge Berman.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">The United States attorney’s office will take the position at that presentment and that conference that Epstein should be detained pending trial. Epstein is charged in a two-count indictment. First conspiracy to commit sex trafficking and second the substantive crime of sex trafficking of underage girls.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">Beginning in at least 2002 and continuing until 2005, Epstein is alleged to have abused dozens of victims by causing them to engage in sex acts with him at his mansion in New York and at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">The victims, all underage girls at the time of the alleged conduct, were given hundreds of dollars in cash after each encounter either by Epstein or by one of Epstein’s employees. The underage girls were initially recruited to provide Epstein with massages and often did so nude or partially nude.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">These massages became increasingly sexual in nature and would typically include one or more sex acts as specified in the indictment. As alleged, Epstein also paid certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused. This allowed Epstein to create an ever-expanding web of new victims.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">This conduct, as alleged, went on for years and it involved dozens of young girls, some as young as 14 years old at the time that they were allegedly abused. As alleged, Epstein was well aware that many of his victims were minors. And not surprisingly, many of the underage girls that Epstein allegedly victimized were particularly vulnerable to exploitation.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">The alleged behavior shocks the conscience. And while the charged conduct is from a number of years ago, it is still profoundly important to the many alleged victims now young women. They deserve their day in court and we are proud to be standing up for them by bringing this indictment.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">Combating sex trafficking and exploitation of children is a priority for this office and for the Department of Justice as the sexual abuse of a minor can have devastating effects on victims often lasting for years. That is why my office will not rest until the perpetrators of these types of crimes are brought to justice.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">Victims’ voices, including the many voices of Epstein’s alleged victims must be heard. To that end I want to say to anyone who was watching this or hearing about our prosecution, if you believe you are a victim of this man Jeffrey Epstein. Or you have evidence or information leading to the conduct alleged in the indictment unsealed today, we want to hear from you. Please call. 1-800-CALL FBI, that’s 1-800-CALL FBI.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">The charges unsealed today reflect the hard work not only of this office, but by our law enforcement partners at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The FBI had failed to bring Epstein to justice back in Florida. Why should his victims believe that it would play out differently this time around, in another jurisdiction? William Sweeney, Assistant-Director-in-Charge of the New York office of the FBI, stepped forward with a message. He began:</p>
<p class="paraNoIndentE">Preserving the innocence in children is one of the most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Purposely failing children in any way is not an option.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">And yet there are some in society who have chosen to blatantly disregard this responsibility, using whatever means they have at their disposal to lure children into a life which they should never have been exposed. As we allege today, Jeffrey Epstein is one of those people.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">At approximately 5:30 p.m. on Saturday evening we arrested him at Teterboro Airport without incident. Epstein has been charged with one count each of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">For at least a four-year period, covering the entirety of 2002 through 2005, he is alleged to have sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls at his homes in New York City and in Palm Beach, Florida.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">The girls were recruited in a variety of ways, usually by employees of Epstein and sometimes by fellow victims. The victims typically received hundreds of dollars in cash. The estimated dozens of victims were as young as fourteen years old at the time of recruitment.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">Children who provided up steam massages while they were nude or partially nude. Children who were asked to engage in direct and indirect sex acts for money. Children who were enticed to do all these things at the hands of a man more than or nearly three times their age. Those who had been victimized by child sexual predators are frequently haunted by memories of these crimes well into their adulthood, often for the rest of their lives. They bear the burden of someone else’s criminal behavior.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">Too often, adults in our society have turned a blind eye to this type of criminal behavior alleged here. We have seen the excuses. The ignorance of many who didn’t even bother to understand that this behavior is this persistent scourge against our society’s vulnerable youth. And the willful blindness as to who the real villains are in this type of outrageous crime.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">The villains are the adult perpetrators, not the children. Victims of child sex trafficking come from all walks of life. They are our neighbors, our students, young adults looking for help, vulnerable foster children, the list goes on and on and on.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">To the victims who may be listening or get word of today’s charges, the team standing here before you represents FBI Special Agents, NYPD detectives, analyst, victim specialist, prosecutors who make it their mission to listen to every individual who’s been exploited and to advocate for the most vulnerable among us.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">We are parents, we are community members, we are human beings. But as an FBI Special Agent and the head of this office, I have the privilege to represent and stand among many who make it our mission to put predators behind bars where they belong, regardless of the predator’s power wealth or perceived connections.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">Today, I’m asking everyone to take a good look at this man. If you have been victimized in any way or if you are somebody who has any additional information about his alleged illegal behavior, we want to hear from you. Whatever age you are now, whatever age you were then, no matter where or when the incident or incidents took place. . . .</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">Your bravery might just empower others to speak out about crimes committed against them. It’s important to remember there never was nor will there be an excuse for this kind of behavior. We know that reliving these events can be brutal. We are here to work side by side with you as you go through this process. You should know that in the eyes of the FBI you come first.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Then, Berman jumped in again: “We’re going to take some questions. But first let me preface it by saying that there’s been a lot of speculation in the media about individuals affiliated or associated with defending Jeffrey Epstein.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“As you know, Justice Department guidelines prohibit us from talking about such individuals, and so I just want to let you know that if that question comes up about any individual, my answer will be, no comment. And that will be across the board no comment.” That part of the investigation, regarding the coconspirators, was clearly ongoing.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">The first question raised by reporters was: If Epstein was bound by the notorious Florida nonprosecution agreement, how had prosecutors been able to bring new charges?</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Berman explained, “Jeffrey Epstein entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the Southern District of Florida. That agreement only binds—by its terms only binds to Southern District of Florida. The Southern District of New York is not bound by that agreement and is not a signatory to that agreement.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">The same would be true for his coconspirators.</p>
<p class="starimage"><img alt="image" src="../Images/star.jpg" width="5%"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Meanwhile, Epstein had a lot of time to consider his next move as he sat locked up in a eight-by-eight jail cell. Immediately after his arrest, Epstein had been taken directly to the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a rust-colored federal detention facility in the heart of Lower Manhattan.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">The “MCC” is where New York’s most cold-blooded criminals are incarcerated while awaiting trial or bail. At the time, the MCC was the temporary home of Mexican kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán and Trump’s presidential campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Previous inmates included mob boss John Gotti, financial fraudster Bernie Madoff, and the 1993 World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">In other words, it was secure. <span class="italic">Or so people thought.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent">Located a few blocks from the Brooklyn Bridge and bustling Chinatown, MCC is one of several federal buildings in the immediate area. The US Attorney’s office, NYPD headquarters, and City Hall are directly nearby. It is, in essence, meant to be the most secure area of the Big Apple.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Like each of the other eight hundred felons at MCC, Epstein was booked, stripped of his identity, and given his inmate number: 76318–054. He was taken to the ninth floor (also known as 9-South), which is a special housing unit for violent inmates and new arrivals who require protective custody. Epstein had to be kept out of the general population, it was thought, because every felon would hit him up—or rough him up—for money.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">But segregation came at a price.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">In 9-South, all 120 inmates are divided into sixty two-man cells. Epstein was locked up in cell number 123 with fifty-two-year-old Nicholas Tartaglione, a brawny retired policeman charged with executing four men in upstate New York.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">The cells in 9-South don’t have bars. Each eight-by-eight-foot unit is completely sealed off by a solid door, which has a narrow rectangular window and a “trap” where food trays are placed. The slot is also used to cuff inmates behind their back before the cell door is opened. Besides a bunk bed and a prominent toilet, each cell has a sink, a small shower in the corner, and a fixed desk and stool. A single frosted-glass window gave Epstein a few inches of daylight from the outside world.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Inmates are locked up for twenty-three-and-a-half hours a day. For the remaining thirty minutes, they are permitted to walk around a small portion of the tier: In Epstein’s case, it was the “M-Tier.” But according to an inmate who was in 9-South with Epstein, the 9-South guards “never let you out of the cell.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“It’s a nightmare,” the inmate told our investigator. “It’s a hellhole for all of us. There are roaches and rats and it’s never cleaned. The cell is rancid and they wouldn’t give Epstein anything to clean it. . . . That place is out of control.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Two days after his arrest, on July 8, Epstein was let out of his cell to attend his first court hearing, where he was officially charged with sex trafficking and conspiracy to traffic minors for sex.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Not surprisingly, an arrogant Epstein pleaded not guilty. The judge scheduled his bail hearing for July 12.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Until then, Epstein and his attorneys planned to use every waking moment to plot their strategy.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“Epstein was taking over one of the only two rooms to meet lawyers in,” his jailmate recalled. “He always tied up the lawyer’s meeting room because he never wanted to be in that cell. That pissed off the inmates and the guards because it seemed like special treatment.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Worse, other witnesses claimed that Epstein and his lawyers routinely sat there in silence. His legal team, it seemed, was only there so he could stretch his legs outside the confines of his cell.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">To further insulate himself from the harsh realities of prison, Epstein had his lawyers transfer money to the commissary accounts of several other inmates, one jail insider told these authors. The recipients could then use the “store credit” to purchase perks like toiletries, snacks, and stationery.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Social chameleon Epstein was at it again in an entirely new crowd, using his money to get people in his pocket.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">But prison was not like his private island. When Epstein started throwing money around, it had an unintended consequence—one that may have proved deadly.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“The guards hated that Epstein got special treatment because of his money,” his former jailmate told us exclusively. “The guards treated Epstein worse than any other inmate.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Inmates had to call the guards if they needed more toilet paper or cleaning supplies, for example, but the guards specifically ignored Epstein and made him “wait for everything,” the jailhouse source claimed.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“They would never bring it when Epstein asked,” his jailmate claimed. “They would always come if Epstein’s bunkie (bunkmate) asked for anything, but never if he did. They would always say the guard on the next shift would take care of it, then that guard would say he knew nothing about it.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">In his hasty attempt to win over his new peers, far from the glitz, glamor—and freedom—of life past, Epstein had irreversibly alienated the true prison power players.</p>
<p class="paraIndent"> The day after his first court hearing, Epstein and his victims got an unexpected surprise. Facing heavy criticism for his handling of Epstein’s 2008 case, former Miami prosecutor Alexander Acosta resigned from Trump’s cabinet under enormous pressure. Pressure, perhaps, for a public whipping boy to take the fall.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“I thought the right thing was to step aside,” Acosta said, claiming that his continued presence as head of the United States Department of Labor would jeopardize President Trump’s goal of “putting the American people first.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“This was him, not me,” Trump declared. “I said, ‘You don’t have to do this.’”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Still, one might wonder if Trump was relieved to dissolve one of the conspicuous links between him and America’s most famous pedophile, dating back decades—decades the public did not know about until this book.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Acosta stepped down and announced that he would devote his time to helping Epstein’s rapidly expanding list of victims. At the time of this writing, it’s unclear what form that mission will take, if any.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Back at MCC, however, Epstein and his legal team plotted their next move. Shockingly, it seemed they truly believed he was going to make bail. Epstein could have begun to daydream about a return to his mansion, with around the clock chaperones in tow, and an ankle bracelet to keep track of his every move.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">At the bail hearing on July 12, the shape of their argument emerged.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Epstein’s attorney focused on the fact that all of the New York accusations against him were alleged to have taken place before 2005. The next fourteen years, free of any public claims, supposedly proved Epstein’s first jail term had “worked.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“He wasn’t a predator that couldn’t control his conduct,” Martin Weinberg told the judge. “He disciplined himself.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">The attorney argued that Epstein was not a “future danger” to girls and could be trusted in the real world.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“It’s not like he’s an out-of-control rapist,” counsel insisted.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">But Judge Berman was not convinced.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“How do you know that?” the Judge pressed, clearly skeptical that the “passage of time” was the proper way to measure the danger of having Epstein on the loose.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Assistant US Attorney Alex Rossmiller seized on that line of thinking.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“They concede that he has to discipline himself,” the attorney answered. “This idea that he has ‘disciplined himself’ is a concession that he has an appetite for children.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">In a Hail Mary play, Weinberg suggested setting Epstein’s bail at $100 million—or more. But Rossmiller’s determination to keep Epstein captive was unshakable.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“What the defendant is asking for here is special treatment, to build his own jail, to be limited in his own gilded cage,” the defense attorney continued. “A person who needs these conditions should be detained. . . . He has every incentive to flee if he is released.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Judge Berman already knew all about <span class="italic">the talented Mr. Epstein</span>. He had been briefed on the pictures, the videos, the money, and the fake passport in Epstein’s safe. He was aware of Epstein’s habit of “generosity” to those who could help him get his way.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Judge Berman had been appointed to his seat on the District Court for the Southern District of New York by Epstein’s former pal, President Bill Clinton. As a steward of the law, Berman wanted to see all of the evidence. He also wanted to hear from Epstein’s victims.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">But first, and most of all, was the pending question of whether to keep Epstein behind bars.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Court adjourned until his decision could be rendered.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">While Judge Berman was considering the evidence, however, a new chapter to the story began. On July 17, an eighteen-year-old woman—identified in her claim as Kaitlyn Doe—filed a lawsuit claiming that Epstein had sexually violated her in October 2008, <span class="italic">while</span> he was on work release from prison at his West Palm Beach “Florida Science Foundation” office. She claimed that a deputy was standing outside the door the entire time and did nothing to thwart the attack.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">According to Doe, the meetings were scheduled to discuss her “necessary surgeries.” Not only did Epstein force her to perform sex acts, according to the filing; but also, Doe claimed he demanded that she marry one of his female recruiters—a non-US citizen who needed a green card.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“Jeffrey Epstein, through his brazen and powerful organization, was quite literally able to commit federal sex trafficking offenses at his work release office, during his jail sentence,” court documents obtained for this book state.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">The victim’s attorney, Brad Edwards, came forward to claim that Epstein used his “work” during prison to sucker many women into sex.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“They believed they were going there for something other than a sexual purpose,” Edwards said. “Not one of the individuals was a prostitute. These were all people who at that time wanted something. They came over under false pretenses and he manipulated them.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Upon learning about the claim, Florida Governor Ron Desantis ordered an immediate—if woefully belated—investigation into Epstein’s work-release program and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s office.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">The following day, unsurprisingly, Epstein’s request for bail was denied.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">In his written order, Judge Berman stated:</p>
<p class="paraNoIndentE">The Government’s evidence against Mr. Epstein appears strong. The evidence includes testimony of victims, some of whom were minor girls when they were allegedly sexually abused by Mr. Epstein; other witnesses, including potential co-conspirators; physical evidence, including passports reflecting extensive foreign travel; sexually suggestive photographs of nude underage girls; plea discussions; and police reports describing witness tampering and intimidation . . .</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">This newly discovered evidence also suggests that Mr. Epstein poses ongoing and forward-looking danger. . . . Mr. Epstein’s dangerousness is considerable and includes sex crimes with minor girls and tampering with potential witnesses . . .</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">Mr. Epstein’s alleged excessive attraction to sexual conduct with or in the presence of minor girls—which is said to include his soliciting and receiving massages from young girls and young women perhaps as many as four times a day—appears likely to be uncontrollable . . .</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">The Court finds that the Government has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that Mr. Epstein is a flight risk. . . . The Court is also concerned for new victims. . . . The Government’s motion for remand (detention) is granted and the Defense motion for pretrial release is denied.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Epstein’s legal team immediately protested, filing an appeal. Either missing or willfully ignoring the enormous scope of the ruling, they focused on Epstein’s fake passport. They claimed it had been used to disguise his Jewish heritage in the Middle East, where he could have been a desirable target for kidnappers. For many, that seemed like a stretch.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">A trial date was set for mid-2020 and Epstein was sent back to his cell. The judge ordered that he would stay there up until the trial.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Of course, he would not.</p>
