<p class="CN">CHAPTER 15</p>
<p class="CT"><span class="line">ONCE UPON A TIME IN RUSSIA</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">In the hours and days following the announcement of Jeffrey Epstein’s death, people across America were watching closely for reports about what exactly had happened. So, it seems, was the Kremlin, also known as the lair of President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">As the news broke, many social media accounts confirmed to be Russian bots began actively promoting salacious and bizarre conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein’s death. The Russian state television channel, RT, led off one nightly broadcast with some of the more outrageous claims. Even President Trump got in on the action, retweeting a post from conservative commentator Terrence K. Williams that read:</p>
<p class="paraNoIndentE">Died of SUICIDE on 24/7 SUICIDE WATCH? Yeah right! How does that happen<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JefferyEpstein?src=hash">#JefferyEpstein</a> had information on Bill Clinton &amp; now he’s dead</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">I see <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TrumpBodyCount?src=hash">#TrumpBodyCount</a> trending but we know who did this!<br/> RT if you’re not Surprised<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EpsteinSuicide?src=hash">#EpsteinSuicide</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClintonBodyCount?src=hash">#ClintonBodyCount</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClintonCrimeFamily?src=hash">#ClintonCrimeFamily</a></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="None">Senator Marco Rubio, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, confirmed that Russian bots and trolls were actively promoting such outlandish theories.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">“The immediate rush to spread conspiracy theories about someone on the ‘other side’ of partisan divide having him killed illustrates why our society is so vulnerable to foreign disinformation and influence efforts,” Rubio tweeted.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">“It’s sad (and frightening) to see so many Americans on both sides . . . unwittingly helping them,” he continued, adding that Putin “has weaponized our polarization.”</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">But why would Putin have a stake in promoting conspiracy theories about Epstein’s death?</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">In one interpretation, it could have been a simple smoke screen, meant to obscure the truth. In another, it could have been a deterrent aimed at anyone asking further questions about the nature of his death.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Who would publicly question the official suicide story when it would mean being lumped in with a bunch of Kremlin bots? Having the courage to do so might require some additional assurance, some inside proof.</span></p>
<p class="starimage"><img alt="image" src="../Images/star.jpg" width="5%"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="None">John Mark Dougan, a former Palm Beach County Deputy Sheriff, told our team</span><span class="italic"> </span><span class="None">that he’s certain Epstein was murdered—and he knows why.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">“I don’t believe for one minute it was suicide,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">The world’s intelligence agencies couldn’t risk the chance of Epstein’s blackmail files ever going public, Dougan claims. Those files are explosive, and he knows. Because he has them.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Dougan served as a Deputy Sheriff in Palm Beach at the time Epstein was in prison after securing his secret plea deal. Now, he lives in Russia, where he has been granted political asylum.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Epstein’s prison time “was an absolute shitshow,” Dougan told author James Robertson from the dark streets of Moscow. “I’ll tell you why. He was able to leave jail basically anytime he wanted. Right? This is really unheard of.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">“But he was able to leave jail as long as he had two deputies go with him on an overtime detail. They were paid as an overtime detail. Now, overtime detail, this is Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, by contract are selected out of a random pool. This was different. These deputies that would go with him were handpicked by the sheriff. And there were guys specifically who would look the other way while he was bringing underage girls into his office and into his home. Unbelievable.”</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Palm Beach Police Detective Joseph Recarey had run the initial investigation into Epstein’s crimes. But once in prison, the case was under the </span><span class="None">jurisdiction</span><span class="None"> of the Sheriffs. Dougan says Recarey gave him full access to </span><span class="None">everything</span><span class="None"> he knew about the infamous inmate.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">“We basically had the entire case file,” he said. According to Dougan, Recarey also gave him materials that were not in the “official” filings as well.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">When asked if he was aware of any blackmail tapes made by Epstein, Dougan was unequivocal:</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndentE"><span class="None">Absolutely. They weren’t tapes so much as DVDs. I don’t know if these were footages or not, but every bedroom in Epstein’s houses had multiple cameras in them.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">He used to keep records of everybody. He used to store everything. So the Palm Beach Police Department, they knew that there were thousands and thousands of these DVDs. Except . . . Now, this is very interesting.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">When they went to search for them, they were gone.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">It’s not really a question of who would have had access. The question you should be asking is: Who had knowledge that the search was coming? And the answer to that is the Palm Beach County State Attorney’s Office and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office. Because the State Attorney’s Office and Sheriff’s Office, they’re the ones who have to take the warrants and take them in front of the judge to get them signed off. There were elements within these two organizations that didn’t want to see anything happen to Epstein.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="None">How far would Epstein’s protectors go to keep their prized asset safe?</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Joseph Recarey, the police officer who had original access to the blackmail files, died suddenly after a “brief illness” at the age of fifty in 2018.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">“It’s funny, because back in May when everything started to happen with Epstein again, when all the ruckus started to get raised again, he mysteriously died,” Dougan said. “I knew this guy, man. He was fit as a fiddle. He was fifty years old. And he died of a sudden illness. That’s what they wrote. ‘He died of a sudden illness.’ It was unexplained.”</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Two years before, Dougan had fled for Russia, taking his own tranche of the tapes with him. He still has them today. Encrypted. Hidden.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">“Do I think that Epstein was probably put up to getting some wealthy people to sleep with some underage women so those people could be blackmailed by Western intelligence agencies? Absolutely I do,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Among those targets, Dougan claims, was Prince Andrew. A September 2019 report in Britain’s </span><span class="italic">Times of London</span><span class="None"> revealed that the MI6 were “</span>concerned that Russia may have obtained kompromat, compromising material, on Prince Andrew.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Dougan insisted to our team that he is not a Russian asset. But in any case, the Kremlin is likely very happy to have the Epstein blackmail files within their borders.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">After the claims about Prince Andrew surfaced, Dougan released the following statement:</p>
<p class="paraNoIndentE">Although we worked in different law enforcement agencies, former Town of Palm Beach Police Department Detective Joe Recarey, who was the lead detective on the solicitation-of-minors case against billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, was a friend. I was shocked, as were family and friends, to learn of his unexpected death at age 50 just over a year ago.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">Joe Recarey was very aware of my efforts to uncover breaches of public trust by the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s office via my award-winning investigative website. In late 2009 or early 2010, Joe asked me to scan all the documents as well as copy hundreds of DVD disks he had on the Jeffrey Epstein case to keep them safe. He had lost faith in Barry Krischer, the Palm Beach County state’s attorney at the time of the investigation. I would meet with him occasionally to get more documents to store, the last time being in 2015.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">I have never looked at what was given to me by Joe Recarey, other than the file names, types, and sizes. The FBI seized my computers in 2016 which had everything Recarey gave me. The FBI and other intelligence agencies may be surprised to have discovered that I kept an off-site backup that was sent to me in 2017, after I was safely established in Russia.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">According to news reports, US intelligence agencies apparently analyzed the files and communicated with British authorities. If Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6, has concerns about any ties between Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein, they got it from their Washington counterparts, not me.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">Of course, this means the FBI has seen everything and has more knowledge of the contents than I do because it was not my business to look deep into the files: I was simply acting as Joe Recarey’s computer “safety deposit box.” It also means that the FBI has the same exact data that I possess and are in a position to know everyone who is implicated in the videos, recordings, and documents. If media reports are accurate, it seems the FBI has knowledge that Epstein files involve Prince Andrew in some manner, since they made it a point to contact MI6 and warn them.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">The Epstein data is encrypted in a TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt container and has been given to a few people. They cannot look at the contents because they do not have the decryption keys. Others have the decryption keys, but they do not have access to the encrypted containers. My contacts are on five continents and do not know each other. The Epstein files stay secure and unreadable to everyone. I do not have a physical copy in my immediate possession, because of security reasons.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">This is to make sure my family and friends remain safe. I have made arrangements that it can only be decrypted in the event of my arrest, if I go missing for an extended time, or in case of my unusual or untimely demise. I have a system in place to connect people with the encrypted containers to those who have the decryption keys.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">I have made elaborate security precautions because of ongoing legal issues, threats, and harassment. The FBI has tried to arrest me twice since I’ve been in Moscow by pushing Interpol via a sealed indictment. Both times they failed. Last year, the FBI sent 10 agents and Federal Marshals to a US company that I do contract work for, unsuccessfully trying to intimidate them.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">I will not be divulging any of the information I may know of or possess, because the secrecy of the data I have access ensures the safety of me and my loved ones. I hope the growing concerns and reports about Jeffrey Epstein’s international sex-trafficking empire, and his relationship with the rich and powerful people like the Duke of York, will generate official and news media investigations which will uncover all the facts.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Not long after releasing that statement, Dougan took matters into his own hands, inviting journalist Ron Chepesiuk to review the materials and confirm their existence. A longtime friend of Dougan, Chepesiuk flew to Moscow on September 24, 2019.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">There, according to Chepesiuk, Dougan cracked open the Epstein blackmail files for the very first time.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“He just wanted to verify,” Chepesiuk told our team. “He suggested it and I said, ‘It’s to verify that they have something there.’ He said, ‘I’m not going to show it to you long.’”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">What happened next shocked the journalist:</p>
<p class="paraNoIndentE">So what happened was, it was less than five minutes, and a couple of random scenes from the thing. It was obviously surveillance tape of a bedroom and there were a couple of younger, may even have been underage, I don’t know, they were very young.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">It was far away and it looked like it was coming from a wall. The camera and all that. It looked like surveillance in a TV show. So I just assumed that it was coming from a camera probably facing, on a wall.”</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">And there was some older men and I didn’t look at them. It was very hard to see it from afar. I wanted to, but they were definitely dealing with some sex, you know? So that was it. Then he closed it up, and took it again and saved whatever he was doing. I didn’t want to know.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">I didn’t want to have the responsibility of trying to identify people so I wasn’t really interested in trying to identify people. I just wanted to look at it and verify that it was what it looked like, surveillance tapes.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">Pretty disgusting. Didn’t want to be a voyeur. I’m not into that sort of thing. That was it. That was it. It was verified, and that was it.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">I guess he wanted to have somebody else say that he had them. We had developed a good working relationship and he trusted me. He just wanted to verify that, because I don’t think he ever looked at the tapes until that moment because he got them from this guy in law enforcement in Palm Beach. He never, what I can gather, really was interested in the contents.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">He was a straight shooter, he gave his word that he would take care of them, and that’s what he did. But he wasn’t really interested in what was going on inside.</p>
<p class="paraIndentE">But he’s been forced to pay more attention to it because of what broke in England with the Prince Andrew connection.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">That’s also the reason, Dougan says, that he fears for his life.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“Now I have the very peculiar problem of worrying about being hunted down by MI6,” he claimed.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Chepesiuk said that during his visit, there were indeed red flags.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“John said that he noticed a car following him,” he recalled.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“Here in Moscow there’s a lot of twists and turns so if you’re moving, twisting and turning and here’s a car that’s always on your, always in sight, you begin to wonder if that car is following you.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“John said the car was behind him right back into the city. It’s about thirty or forty kilometers. It’s way out there that the alternative airport route in Moscow. So it was a long journey to have this car in the back of you all this way.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Dougan says he’s right to be concerned. Recarey’s sudden death in 2018—at the age of fifty—shocked those who knew him, as well as those who have followed the Epstein case.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Few people have noted, however, that he was not the only mysterious death in the Palm Beach area during that period. In April 2018, almost exactly one month before Recarey’s death, attorney Alan Ross, who represented an Epstein victim in the early civil suits, died of a similarly fast-acting cancer at age sixty-eight.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Before that, the houseman who cleaned Epstein’s sex toys, Alfredo Rodriguez, died of a fast-acting, six-month cancer in 2015, almost exactly at the same time as Virginia Roberts Giuffre’s civil case brought the Epstein story—and Prince Andrew’s part in it—back into the open. He was only sixty.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“Of course, he knew all about Prince Andrew,” Rodriguez’s widow, Patricia Dunn said at the time.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Recarey’s Floridian wife told <span class="italic">Epstein: Dead Men Tell No Tales</span> that he passed from cancer, too.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Was it just a coincidence that these three men, all in Florida, died similar deaths that seemed timed to developments in the Epstein case? Poisoning by arsenic, heavy metals, and radioactive substances are all known to cause cancer in humans.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Dougan says he’s not taking any chances. His family left behind in the United States, he wonders if he’ll ever see them again.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“Look, somebody has to expose the evil people, I guess you would say. Somebody’s gotta do it, right? And somebody has to pay the price. Am I happy that I’ve done what I’ve done? Yeah. I’m very happy with what I’ve done so far.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“But now you’re asking me, is it worth it for me to have lost my children? I don’t know, man. I mean, no.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">With the blackmail tapes now in the Kremlin’s grasp and with the potential to circulate worldwide, some now have a lot more to lose.</p>
