<p class="CN">CHAPTER 16</p>
<p class="CT"><span class="line">THE COCONSPIRATORS</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Less than six months before the 2016 election, reporters covering the presidential campaign trail were rocked by an incoming missile: An anonymous woman listed as “Katie Johnson” filed a lawsuit in California accusing Epstein of raping her at his Manhattan home back in 1994, when she was just thirteen.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">The claims were similar to those in other lawsuits that had been filed against Epstein in the past, except for one thing: Donald Trump was listed as an alleged coconspirator and fellow rapist.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">The moment the lawsuit came across our collective computer screens in the newsroom of employer American Media, Inc., our team sprang into action. <span class="None">Author Howard summoned reporters Melissa Cronin, Doug Montero, Sharon Churcher, Gina Bacchiocchi, and Robert Hartlein to investigate.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent">Court documents listed Johnson’s address in Twentynine Palms, California, not far from author Cronin’s Palm Springs home. Speeding out to knock on Johnson’s door, Cronin’s mind raced with questions: Who would she find there? After covering Epstein’s crimes for years, would this be the moment to crack it all open?</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Flying through the desert in her car on speakerphone with the reporting team in New York, Cronin turned onto a dusty side street. She had beaten every other reporter there. But she didn’t find Johnson. Instead, at the lawsuit’s address was a boarded-up, abandoned home. Neighbors called it a “crack house,” and said it had most recently been occupied by squatters.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Canvassing businesses in the small, windswept town, Cronin found that no one had ever heard of a “Katie Johnson,” nor knew anything about the lawsuit, Epstein, or Trump. <span class="None">Indeed, a “neighbor,” Danny Mira, told us that no one had lived at the home since its owner, David Stacey, died in October the year prior.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Mira said he and other neighbors had kept a close watch on the home because it was overrun by drug addicts who squatted there while Stacey was hospitalized in the final days of his life.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">The neighbors, with the help of police, managed to clean up the home several months before Stacey’s death. Sharon Rose, a local Realtor, told us the property went into default shortly after Stacey’s death and was officially taken over by the bank on April 11—fifteen days before the woman filed her suit.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">What’s more, the phone number the woman listed on the court documents was not connected, and she also told the court she had less than $300 to her name in savings.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent">It was clear the lawsuit was some kind of a red herring. Speculation ran wild: Had the Clintons planted this to smear Trump and torpedo his campaign? Had Trump planted this in a canny bit of reverse psychology? (I.e. If the suit were dismissed for being fake, other claims against him would seem fake and illegitimate as well.)</p>
<p class="paraIndent">The truth was even stranger. The man behind the Katie Johnson lawsuit was a former Jerry Springer producer who called himself “Al Taylor,” a.k.a. notorious gossip peddler Norm Lubow. (Lubow was also behind a 2011 story that claimed Justin Bieber had impregnated a fan, Mariah Yeater.)</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Lubow’s wingman was a conservative antiabortion donor, Steve Baer, who also happened to be a “Never Trumper.” Taylor claimed to have met Johnson and heard her story at a party several years before.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Her attorney, Tom Meagher, said she was motivated to come forward at last, with Taylor’s backing, to ensure that her rapist would not become president.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Trump’s team told author Howard the accusations in the lawsuit were “unequivocally false” and “politically motivated.” Even for Trump skeptics, the entire lawsuit seemed fishy from the start.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">First, why had she filed from a nonexistent address? Why had no one seemed to have ever met her?</p>
<p class="paraIndent">An attorney that represented Johnson admitted even he had trouble tracking her down. For reporters, it was just as difficult.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Journalist Emily Shugerman said Johnson’s reps promised her a video interview with the plaintiff, only to cancel on her several times. Were we all being catfished?</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Armed with this information, author Howard told attorney Lisa Bloom that our own investigation was turning up red flags, and warned Bloom of a lack of corroborating evidence. These types of conversations are routine in the world of journalism, and <span class="italic">New York Times </span>reporters have revealed that they also warned Bloom in this case.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Bloom waded in regardless, and announced that she would unveil Johnson at a press conference in November 2016, just days before the election.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">When the hour came, Johnson was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">“Jane Doe has received numerous threats today. . . . She has decided she is too afraid to show her face,” Bloom told the gathered reporters. “We’re going to have to reschedule.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">The case was soon dismissed in California for procedural issues, and “Johnson” refiled in New York, only to drop it again.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Today, many still believe that the Katie Johnson suit was another case of a victim silenced by the crushing jaws of the justice system, another clever escape for Epstein and Trump.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">However, our team has been unable to confirm that “Katie Johnson” ever existed. For us, the whole caper is eerily reminiscent of the conspiracy trolls that surfaced after Epstein’s death. Plant one crazy fake lawsuit about an Epstein coconspirator, and all the other potential revelations seem just as insane by association.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">When approached in an effort to learn the truth about Johnson, Taylor told Howard: “You know I have details about the Clintons’ involvement in the whole Katie Johnson affair.” He refused to go on further for fear of retribution from those involved in what he characterized as a fictitious scheme.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">By the time “Katie” had first appeared in 2016, however, Epstein’s real coconspirators must have been getting nervous.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Depositions in the Jane Doe case and Virginia Roberts Giuffre’s lawsuit continued to reveal new allegations and names on an almost weekly basis. In 2015, Giuffre’s claims against Prince Andrew had dropped a bombshell on Buckingham Palace (claims he, of course, denied).</p>
<p class="starimage"><img alt="image" src="../Images/star.jpg" width="5%"/></p>
<p class="paraIndentT">Ever since Epstein’s 2008 plea deal secured immunity for his “unnamed co-conspirators,” the world had wondered who those people were. With his death in August 2019, it seemed as if the world might never know.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">For Epstein victim Michelle Licata, it was chilling:</p>
<p class="paraNoIndentE"><span class="None">He wouldn’t have been able to commit suicide. Would he have been able to be murdered? Sure.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">I mean, there are a lot of people that are just walking around like, ‘You need to shut this down. . . . He is blowing my cover,’ is what it felt like.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">It was like all these people’s dirty secret started coming out one after another after another. I can see those people that are the people that are paying to keep themselves out of jail and out of prison.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">Those people are like, “Look I don’t care what it takes. You need to shut this up. You need to, I don’t know, make him disappear. Make the story disappear. Make these girls be quiet.” That’s what’s happening.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">I mean, it seems like they are letting us talk, but that’s what’s happening.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="None">Will those coconspirators let the victims keep talking forever? This investigation has learned of death threats to at least one victim who spoke out recently.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">In addition, victim Alicia Arden told us that she fears she has been blacklisted from working in the entertainment world since filing her police report.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">“I feel that I may have been blacklisted by Jeffrey Epstein’s network. I thought, did someone say something? ‘Oh we don’t want to work with Alicia, because if we do anything to her, she’ll go file a police report.’ So I thought that that could have blacklisted me a little,” she told author Cronin.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">“Because the girls that you see now, that have other Hollywood predators in the news, I don’t see them working very much. They’ve brought up what happened to them, and they’ve talked about what happened to them, and they’ve been blacklisted. Why shouldn’t we be able to come out and talk about that?”</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Meanwhile, the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, at least, has vowed to continue the fight to bring coconspirators to justice.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">On the day of Epstein’s death, Manhattan US Attorney Geoffrey Berman released a statement that said: “</span>To those brave young women who have already come forward and to the many others who have yet to do so, let me reiterate that we remain committed to standing for you, and our investigation of the conduct charged in the Indictment—which included a conspiracy count—remains ongoing.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Attorney Gloria Allred revealed to our team:</p>
<p class="paraNoIndentE"><span class="None">When I was in court while we were waiting for the court hearing to begin, I spoke with the United States Attorney, Mr. Berman, before the hearing began, and I introduced him to my client in the courtroom, and he did assure them in my presence and he assured me that they are continuing their investigation of any potential co-conspirators.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">We should always keep in mind that when Mr. Epstein was indicted in this latest proceeding, there also in the indictment was not only the indictment of Mr. Epstein but the indictment also talked about unnamed co-conspirators. So even before his death, the Justice Department was interested in that.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">And it maybe that now that he is deceased, more victims will be more willing to speak about who may have been in that chain to recruit them, to manage them, to pay them.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="None">Allred also noted that as the search for evidence continues, it may turn up new names—and more proof.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">“I understand there’s a grand jury that has been looking into the circumstances of Mr. Epstein’s death,” she told us.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">“There are many civil cases that are and will be ongoing, seeking discovery, seeking to find out the truth, and then there’s the criminal investigation, which is probably more powerful than anything else, because the United States government has more resources than anyone else has.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">“So I don’t think any businessperson or celebrity or powerful man should rest easy and think, “Oh, well, there’s not enough evidence.”</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">“Well, maybe there is.”</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="None">Indeed, two weeks after Epstein’s death, authorities in France announced that they were launching their own investigation into sex crimes that might have occurred in Epstein’s Paris home. In September 2019, they raided the posh apartment near the Arc de Triomphe, as well as the home and offices of his associate, modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel. Brunel was named as a coconspirator in the unsealed Virginia Roberts Giuffre documents. He founded the MC2 modeling agency in 2005, reportedly with $1 million in seed money from Epstein.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Phone messages to Epstein from Brunel, found in Epstein’s Palm Beach home and obtained by this team, suggest that Brunel may have connected Epstein with young models. The undated messages from Brunel to Epstein, as captured by Epstein’s assistants, read:</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndentE"><span class="None">He just did a good one . . . She spoke to me and said, “I love Jeffrey.”</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">Jean-Luc “is in serious conversation about Alina’s butt and he needs your precision.”</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">“He has a teacher for you to teach you how to speak Russian. She is 2X8 years old not blonde. Lessons are free and you can have your 1st today if you call.”</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">“Jean Luc spoke to the doctor about your symptoms. It’s Bratislavian various. It can be cured but you have to move. It can cause atrophy of the muscle which can shorten your sex life.”</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="None">The day we submitted this manuscript to the publisher, Brunel announced that he was willing to work with French prosecutors. On that day, his location was still unknown.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Homayra Sellier, the president of sex-trafficking-prevention organization Innocence in Danger, was behind the push for the investigation in France.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">She explained:</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndentE"><span class="None">We had women who came forward and they wanted to have juridical help to see what could be done with their testimonies, with their stories in France,” she said, “in order to be a good citizen and to respect their duty as a mother, as a woman, as a citizen. So, they were guided to our juridical team, and they were forwarded at the discretion of the prosecutors and those who are doing the investigation.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">In general terms, I believe that one of them concerns Mr. Epstein. Maybe also more, the other partners, or the other friends of his.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">From my understanding, when he was operating in Paris, in France, it was very very very similar to the way he was operating in the rest of the world. He had friends who were recruiting young girls for modeling. Many of them were recruited to do those so-called massages, and they were going to his house. Then, once they were there . . . it was not a massage; at least, not for all of them.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">I think his activity in France must have been quite big. I do think he had friends, maybe others who were putting him in touch with models.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">Honestly, I think what happened in France is very, very, very similar to what happened in the US. You know this black book that was found or given or whatever? In that black book, there are apparently over sixty, seventy names of French people and there is a big number of women who are named as masseuses. But this is very similar to those who were going to his house in New York. So, it’s the same operating system because it worked for him there, why would he change it?</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="None">According to Selliers, coconspirators around the globe could be exposed.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">“I am not sure that the investigations will stop with the US and France,” she said. “I had a call from some people who live in Belgium, and they were saying that people would like to expand the course of action in Belgium. Maybe then Germany. There were German models who were friends of Mr. Epstein, and who were going in his house, going to his parties. Even hosting parties with him.”</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Criminal investigations are not the only hope for future justice, however.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Several victims have already filed civil lawsuits in the hopes of getting closure—or cash—from Epstein’s estate. Gloria Allred, Lisa Bloom, and Spencer Kuvin all represent victims continuing the fight, and each said that Epstein’s coconspirators should not think for a second that they’re off the hook.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">“To the men in power, I hope they’re afraid,” Bloom said.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Allred, her mother, warned that more lawsuits are on the way:</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndentE"><span class="None">Victims should know that they can file a civil lawsuit as a Jane Doe. That is our plan, at least for most if not all of our victims. We’re going to be filing as Jane Does.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">Members of the public do not need to know who they are, and they won’t know who they are. Of course, a defendant has the right to know who’s suing him, but the public does not need to know.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="None">Shockingly, Epstein’s coconspirators are trying to co-opt that strategy for their own devious devices. On September 3, 2019, an unnamed “John Doe” filed court papers begging a judge to block his name from being released in the event that Virginia Roberts Giuffre succeeded in unsealing more documents from her civil lawsuits.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">The mysterious John admitted he didn’t even know if he would be mentioned in the documents, but he would be taking no chances. His attorneys said they knew the explosive filings could include a “range of allegations of sexual acts involving the Plaintiff and non-parties to this litigation, some famous, some not; the identities of non-parties who either allegedly engaged in sexual acts with Plaintiff or who allegedly facilitated such acts.” His attorneys did not confirm whether Doe could be considered famous or not.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Aside from Epstein’s famous friends, his former staffers and “recruiters” like Ghislaine Maxwell are also now stalked by the searchlight as they hide out around the world.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">One, Nadia Marcinkova (a.k.a. Nadia Marcinko), was yet another pretty young blonde in Epstein’s roster of sex slaves. Brought from Yugoslavia at the age of sixteen, she quickly became one of Epstein’s favorite companions.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">During the Palm Beach investigation, a sixteen-year-old victim told cops that Epstein had forced her to perform oral sex on Marcinkova. Still, when police swooped in on Epstein, Marcinkova was spared. His non-prosecution </span><span class="None">agreement</span><span class="None"> specifically named her as a coconspirator who would receive </span><span class="None">immunity</span><span class="None"> from further prosecution, along with other alleged victims-turned-­recruiters, Adriana Ross, and Sarah Kellen. (His assistant, Lesley Groff, was also named.)</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">That immunity agreement is only valid, however, in Southern Florida—not New York.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">When asked about Marcinkova’s role in the global sex ring, and whether she could be prosecuted, her attorneys told the </span><span class="italic">New York Times</span><span class="None">: </span>“Like other victims, Nadia Marcinko is and has been severely traumatized” and “needs time to process and make sense of what she has been through before she is able to speak out.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Marcinkova was unique among Epstein’s girls in that she was able to attract attention outside of his inner circle. She trained as a pilot under his sponsorship, and built a huge YouTube following as the sassy and sexy “Global Girl.” Now, other female pilots and aviation community members are disgusted to learn about what she may have witnessed or done.</p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">“What Nadia Marcinko knows is a lot,” said Florida air safety investigator Christine Negroni. “She has seen everything. When we talk about Jeffrey Epstein and the kind of information he took to the grave, he is not the only one who has that kind of information.”</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Negroni continued in an exclusive interview:</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndentE"><span class="None">She is also very, very aware of what happened in that house and his network of people, many of whom flew on his airplanes, many of whom have been reported to have participated in some of these activities.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">It’s a tough spot for her to be in. I don’t know: is she perpetrator? Is she victim? Reports suggest she came to the United States at the age of fourteen and that there were documents that suggested Epstein bought her from Slovakia at the age of fourteen.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">So it’s very hard for me, and I hope for everyone, to be judgmental about a woman who may have facilitated these horrible crimes on young women when she herself might have been a victim. She seems to have made the best out of a bad situation. Whether that should be held against her I don’t know.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndentE"><span class="None">She has a heck of a story to tell. The question is whether she’ll tell it.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="None">Of course, perhaps the only person who knows the whole story—from sex trafficking to espionage and everything in between—is Ghislaine Maxwell. Conveniently, at the time of this writing, she seems to have disappeared into thin air.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Days after Epstein’s death, it was reported that she had been living in the quiet Massachusetts fishing village of Manchester-by-the-Sea, in the mansion of former boyfriend Scott Borgerson.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">While Ghislaine was on the run, Epstein victim, Jennifer Araoz, filed a new lawsuit against her, alleging: “Maxwell participated with and assisted Epstein in maintaining and protecting his sex trafficking ring, ensuring that approximately three girls a day were made available to him.”</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">But when reporters swarmed the Massachusetts seaside town, Ghislaine was already gone—if she’d ever even been there in the first place.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Our reporters went on the hunt in Europe and the United States. Then suddenly, there was a wholly unexpected twist: The </span><span class="italic">New York Post</span><span class="None"> published a photo of Ghislaine gazing defiantly at the camera while sitting at a Los Angeles In-N-Out, burger and fries in front of her.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Supposedly, the image had been taken by a lucky bystander who happened to recognize the woman who was then the world’s most wanted.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">But once you looked closer at the image, strange details began to emerge. </span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">First, Ghislaine had a book in front of her: </span><span class="italic">The Book of Honor: The Secret Lives and Deaths of CIA Operatives. </span><span class="None">It hardly seems like it could have been a coincidental choice. More likely, it was a pointed message to someone—or everyone.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Second, an advertisement in the background showed an ad for the movie </span><span class="italic">Good Boys</span><span class="None">, a raunchy comedy in which preteens make R-rated sex jokes. The ad had been photoshopped into the image. The real ad at that location was for a local hospital.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">There was also another clue that told family friend Laura Goldman that it was all a setup: “When I saw the picture of Ghislaine Maxwell at In-N-Out, I knew it was a fake immediately because she doesn’t eat. Jeffrey liked thin women, so she starved herself to death. There was no way she was eating a hamburger and french fries!”</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Later, a source would confirm to our team that the middleman—or middle woman, rather—who peddled the photo to the paper is a high-end Beverly Hills Realtor with property listings in Israel.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">“I just talked to someone who texted with Ghislaine,” Goldman revealed. “So she’s definitely not in American witness protection. I think she’s out of the country.”</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Goldman is sure of one thing: Someone has helped Ghislaine go deep, deep underground. Was it her spy handlers?</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">“If you know the Maxwell family, you know they’re their own little team,” Goldman said. “The seven siblings and Mrs. Maxwell supported each other completely.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">“Ghislaine’s sister Isabel has been married three times,” Goldman said. “Her last husband also died mysteriously. They liked larger-than-life men.”</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Men, like their father, who had ties to international intelligence agencies.</span></p>
<p class="starimage"><img alt="image" src="../Images/star.jpg" width="5%"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="None">Really, if you dig deep enough, the most powerful men of the twentieth century do have that one trait in common. While not all agents themselves, like Epstein, nearly without exception the leading figures of our time are connected by shadowy threads to the web of international intelligence, sexual blackmail, and the trafficking and abuse of children.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">In a riveting series for </span><a href="http://MintPress.com">MintPress.com</a>, <span class="None">Chilean journalist Whitney Webb traced sexual blackmail practices back to 1920s and 1930s America, when leading liquor salesman Stan Rosenstiel hosted bugged “blackmail parties” with young boys for party favors. Rosenstiel invited the rich and powerful, for very specific reasons. Webb cites a Florida </span><span class="italic">Sun Sentinel</span><span class="None"> report that alleges Rosentiel was once overheard saying “if the government ever brings pressure” against him or his pal, notorious mafioso Meyer Lansky, he’d use his recordings as blackmail.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">During World War II, such techniques became more mainstream as the US intelligence community looked to mobsters and underworld kings for techniques to help them win against the Nazis. After the war, the wise guys’ participation earned them a lifetime of “get out of jail free” cards.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Meanwhile, Lansky didn’t limit himself to connections with and favors for the CIA. The shadowy character also worked with leading figures of the Mossad to launder money in the Middle East.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Supposedly, Lansky’s own sexual blackmail ring was responsible for obtaining blackmail photos of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, leading to even more lenient treatment of Lansky and his associates throughout the 1950s and 1960s.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Although a victim himself, Hoover also was famous for collecting blackmail files on leading Americans, including the members of Camelot—the Kennedy family, and specifically President John F. Kennedy. Did he learn the tactic from America’s original blackmailer, Rosenstiel? Hoover and the liquor baron were close friends, and Rosenstiel even donated $1 million to the J. Edgar Hoover Foundation.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Both men cultivated a mentorship of rising young politico Roy Cohn—Donald Trump’s future mentor. Cohn became Senator Joseph McCarthy’s adviser, and later worked with Ronald Reagan’s administration. His meteoric rise through the ranks of the American elite, it seems, was due to his own “blackmail parties.”</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Rosenstiel’s fourth wife, Susan Kaufman, later claimed to have attended one such party in 1968 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. Kaufman said that in addition to Hoover himself in drag (going by the name “Mary”) she saw young boys engaging in sexual behavior with Hoover, Cohn, and her then-husband.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Multiple reports claim that Cohn was unapologetic about hosting the gatherings, insisting that they were part of his anti-Communist crusade.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">As with Epstein, Webb writes, many turned a blind eye to Cohn’s activities. He was simply too connected, and had too much dirt, to take down.</span></p>
<p class="paraIndent"><span class="None">Trump’s former adviser Roger Stone explained: “</span>Roy was not gay. He was a man who liked having sex with men. Gays were weak, effeminate. He always seemed to have these young blond boys around. It just wasn’t discussed. He was interested in power and access.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Donald Trump would later buy Cohn’s party palace, the Plaza, and host his own debaucherous bashes there throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Male model Andy Lucchesi told reporter Michael Gross that such parties were populated by “a lot of girls . . . 14, look 24. That’s as juicy as I can get. I never asked how old they were. I just partook.”</p>
<p class="paraIndent">But Cohn’s influence, like Epstein’s, spanned both sides of the political aisle. His cousin, Dick Morris, was a close adviser to Bill Clinton. Cohn had connections in media, too: He was friends with FOX News head honcho Rupert Murdoch, and called Barbara Walters his “wife.” His high school the pals turned friends for life included Si Newhouse Jr., Generoso Pope Jr. of the <span class="italic">National Enquirer</span>, and Richard Berlin, who owned Hearst. Many of Cohn’s connections would later become close with Jeffrey Epstein as well.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Roy Cohn died in 1986, but sexual blackmail—including the trafficking of children—would continue to permeate the highest levels of American society.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">In June 1989, George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush were photographed visiting the Covenant House, a Catholic charity for homeless kids in Manhattan. It had been founded under the direction of Cohn’s friend and frequent party guest, Cardinal Francis Spellman. Bush’s Yale roommate, Robert Macauley, was on the organization’s board. (His AmeriCares foundation funded Covenant House, while also working with the CIA to fund the Contras in South America. Like Epstein, Macauley lived in Palm Beach.)</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Just weeks after the presidential pair’s visit, Covenant House was the topic of a jaw-dropping exposé by the <span class="italic">New York Post</span>, which alleged that extensive child sex abuse had happened there.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">That same year, the <span class="italic">Washington Post</span> reported that former NBC News correspondent Craig Spence had been caught running a D.C. child sex ring that provided underage sex slaves to powerful men in apartments that were bugged and rigged with security cameras. Even his parties, which hosted members of the Reagan and Bush administrations, had been bugged for gathering blackmail material. Spence even brought his prisoners to the White House for late-night encounters (not with the president).</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Like Epstein, Spence often boasted to his friends and colleagues that he was working for the CIA. Also like Epstein, after his dirty deeds were exposed, Spence was found dead—supposedly by suicide.</p>
<p class="starimage"><img alt="image" src="../Images/star.jpg" width="5%"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">For many, Epstein seems like a singular monster; at least, upon first encounter. A personification of evil that is deeper and darker than our society has ever known. Ultimately, however, the painful truth is that he was really nothing special.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Epstein’s predecessors were many. Over the course of decades, none of them were stopped.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">With Epstein gone, we are forced to face the sad fact that he will not be the historic first in this dark saga to face justice. As he joins the trail of heartbreak started by his predecessors, we are left to ask: Who are his contemporaries in sexual blackmail and the exploitation of children for espionage? And who are his successors?</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Somewhere, it is certain, there are people who consider themselves to be the heirs to Epstein’s darkest legacy: whether male or female, American or foreign, working for the CIA, MI6, or the Mossad.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Some we may suspect. Others will never raise the slightest hint of impropriety. Some we may even know.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">It was not possible to stop Epstein, even with all of the stories we wrote and all of the brutal facts we exposed while he was living.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">It may not even be possible to unravel his entire twisted life and network within the span of our lifetimes.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">Dead men tell no tales, but we are compelled to tell them: stories of crimes, of conspiracies, of darkness.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">In addition, we are compelled to listen: to those who missed the red flags, to victims whose lives were changed in an instant.</p>
<p class="paraIndent">It is only in doing so that we can raise the slightest hope, the slightest chance, that we may ever stop the ones who wish to follow in Epstein’s footsteps.</p>
